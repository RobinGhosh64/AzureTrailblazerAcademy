# Intelligent analytics hands-on lab step-by-step

## Overview

First Up Consultants specialize in building software solutions for the hospitality industry. Their latest product is an enterprise mobile/social chat product called Concierge+ (aka ConciergePlus). The mobile web app enables guests to easily stay in touch with the concierge and other guests, enabling greater personalization and improving their experience during their stay. Sentiment analysis is performed on top of chat messages as they occur, enabling hotel operators to keep tabs on guest sentiments in real-time.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The preferred solution is shown to meet the customer requirements. From right to left there is an architecture diagram which shows the connections from a mobile device to a Web Application. The Web Application is shown setting data to an Event Hub which is connected to a Web Job. From there Event Hub and Service Bus work together with Stream Analytics, Power BI and Cosmos DB to provide the full solution.](images/preferred-solution-architecture4.jpg "Solution architecture")

Messages are sent from browsers running within laptop or mobile clients via SignalR to an endpoint running in an Azure Web App. Chat messages received by the Web App are sent to an Event Hub where they are temporarily stored. An Azure Function picks up the chat messages and applies sentiment analysis to the message text (using the Text Analytics API), as well as contextual understanding (using LUIS). The function forwards the chat message to an Event Hub used to store messages for archival purposes, and to a Service Bus Topic which is used to deliver the message to the intended recipients. A Stream Analytics Job provides a simple mechanism for pulling the chat messages from the second Event Hub and writing them to Cosmos DB for archiving. An indexer runs atop Cosmos DB that updates the Azure Search index which provides full text search capability. Messages in the Service Bus Topic are pulled by Subscriptions created in the Web App and running on behalf of each client device connected by SignalR. When the Subscription receives a message, it is pushed via SignalR down to the browser-based app and displayed in a web page. Bot Services hosts a bot created using QnA maker, which automatically answers simple questions asked by site visitors.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
- A virtual machine configured with:
  - Visual Studio Community 2019 or later.
  - Azure SDK 2.9 or later (Included with Visual Studio 2019).

In this section, you will implement the message forwarding from the ingest Event Hub instance to an Event Hub instance and a Service Bus Topic. You will also configure the web-based components, which consist of two parts: The Web App UI and the Function App that runs the EventProcessorHost.

### Task 1: Implement the event processor

1. On your Lab VM, open the **ConciergePlusSentiment.sln** file that you downloaded using Visual Studio, if it is not already open.

2. Open **ProcessChatMessage.cs** (found within the **ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction** project in the Solution Explorer).

    ![Visual Studio Solution Explorer displays the ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction project expanded with the ProcessChatMessage.cs file selected.](images/vs-process-chat-message.png "Visual Studio")

3. Scroll down to the **Run** method. This method represents the heart of the message processing logic utilized by the Event Processor Host running in an Azure function. It is provided a collection of EventData instances, each of which represent a chat message in the solution.

    ![A Visual Studio source code window is displayed with the method signature of the Run method shown.](images/2020-06-30-14-37-10.png "Run method")

4. Locate **TODO: 1** through **TODO: 5**  and confirm that those lines of code are uncommented. Leave **TODO: 6** and **TODO: 7** commented out for now. Your code should look exactly like code below:

```csharp
//TODO: 1.Extract the JSON payload from the binary message
string sourceEventHubEventBody = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventData.Body);
var sentimentMessage = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<MessageType>(sourceEventHubEventBody);

//TODO: 6 Append sentiment score to chat message object
//if (sentimentMessage.messageType.Equals("chat", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
//{
//    sentimentMessage.score = await GetSentimentScore(sentimentMessage);
//    log.LogInformation("SentimentScore: " + sentimentMessage.score);
//}

//TODO: 2.Create a Message (for Service Bus) and EventData instance (for EventHubs) from source message body
var updatedMessage = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(sentimentMessage);
var chatMessage = new Message(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(updatedMessage));

// Write the body of the message to the console.
log.LogInformation($"Sending message: {updatedMessage}");

//TODO: 3.Copy the message properties from source to the outgoing message instances
foreach (var prop in eventData.Properties)
{
    chatMessage.UserProperties.Add(prop.Key, prop.Value);
}

//TODO: 4.Send chat message to Topic
//Send the message to the topic which will be eventually picked up by ChatHub.cs in the web app.
await topicClient.SendAsync(chatMessage);

//TODO: 5.Send chat message to next EventHub (for archival)
using var eventBatch = archiveEventHubClient.CreateBatch();
EventData updatedEventData = new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(updatedMessage));

eventBatch.TryAdd(updatedEventData);
await archiveEventHubClient.SendAsync(eventBatch);
log.LogInformation("Forwarded message to event hub.");

//TODO: 7.Respond to chat message intent if appropriate
//var updatedMessageObject = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<MessageType>(updatedMessage);

// Get your most likely intent based on your message.
//var intent = await GetIntentAndEntities(updatedMessageObject.message);
//await HandleIntent(intent, updatedMessageObject, topicClient);
```

<!--
    ```csharp
    //TODO: 1.Extract the JSON payload from the binary message
    string sourceEventHubEventBody = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventData.Body);
    var sentimentMessage = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<MessageType>(sourceEventHubEventBody);

    //TODO: 12 Append sentiment score to chat message object
    //if (sentimentMessage.messageType.Equals("chat", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    //{
    //    sentimentMessage.score = await GetSentimentScore(sentimentMessage);
    //    log.LogInformation("SentimentScore: " + sentimentMessage.score);
    //}

    //TODO: 2.Create a Message (for Service Bus) and EventData instance (for EventHubs) from source message body
    var updatedMessage = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(sentimentMessage);
    var chatMessage  = new Message(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(updatedMessage));

    // Write the body of the message to the console.
    log.LogInformation($"Sending message: {updatedMessage}");

    //TODO: 3.Copy the message properties from source to the outgoing message instances
    foreach (var prop in eventData.Properties)
    {
        chatMessage.UserProperties.Add(prop.Key, prop.Value);
    }

    //TODO: 4.Send chat message to Topic
    // Send the message to the topic which will be eventually picked up by ChatHub.cs in the web app.
    await topicClient.SendAsync(chatMessage);

    //TODO: 5.Send chat message to next EventHub (for archival)
    using var eventBatch = archiveEventHubClient.CreateBatch();
    EventData updatedEventData = new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(updatedMessage));

    eventBatch.TryAdd(updatedEventData);
    await archiveEventHubClient.SendAsync(eventBatch);
    Console.WriteLine("Forwarded message to event hub.");
    ```
-->

5. Save the file.

### Task 2: Configure the Chat Message Processor Function App

1. Navigate to your Function App in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). You can find it by opening your **intelligent-analytics** Resource Group and looking through the list of resources.

2. Select the **Configuration** link in the **Overview** blade of the **Function App**. Choose the **Application settings** link.

    ![The Overview tab is selected in the Function App. The Configuration link is highlighted in the Configured features section.](images/2020-08-16-16-44-35.png "Configuration Link")

3. You will add the following application settings. The following sections walk you through the process of retrieving the values for the Application settings.  If you have already captured these values, you can skip ahead to the adding the **New application setting**.

    ```text
    ChatTopicPath  (e.g. awhotel)
    DestinationEventHubName  (e.g. awchathub2)
    EventHubConnectionString

    ServiceBusConnectionString
    SourceEventHubName   (e.g. awchathub)
    StorageAccountKey
    StorageAccountName

    TextAnalyticsAccountKey
    TextAnalyticsAccountName
    TextAnalyticsBaseUrl
    ```

    > **Note**: It is beneficial to open a second tab or browser window and access the Azure Portal. This way one instance of the Azure Portal may be used to populate the application settings, and the second one can be used to navigate to different resources to obtain key values, connection strings, and URLs. If you decide to use only a single instance of the Azure Portal, be sure to **Save** application settings (available in the Application Settings toolbar) before leaving the screen.

#### Event Hub connection string

The connection string required by the ChatMessageSentimentProcessor is different from the typical Event Hub consumer, because not only does it need Listen permissions, but it also needs Send and Manage permissions on the Service Bus Namespace (because it receives messages, as well as creates Subscriptions).

1. To get the **EventHubConnectionString**, navigate to the Event Hub namespace in the Azure Portal by selecting **Resource Groups** on the left menu, then selecting the **intelligent-analytics** resource group, and selecting your **Event Hubs Namespace** from the list of resources.

      ![In the Access Keys section, the value for Key1 and its copy button are selected.](images/2019-03-20-19-39-42.png "Access Keys section")

#### Service Bus connection string

1. Navigate to the **Service Bus Namespace Overview** page. From the left menu, select the **Shared Access policies** link in the **Settings** section. Select the **ChatConsole** from the list of policies and copy the **Primary Connection String** value and paste into your text file.

    ![The screen shows the service bus Shared access policies.  The ChatConsole policy is listed.](images/2019-11-16-12-53-19.png "Service Bus - Shared access policies")

2. Return to the Function App's Application Settings and create a new setting with the **Name** `ServiceBusConnectionString` and paste this connection string as the **Value**.

#### Chat topic

1. Create a new application setting with the **Name** `ChatTopicPath`. Enter the name of the Service Bus Topic you had created (e.g., `awhotel`) as the **Value**. This can be found under **Topics** on the **Service Bus Namespace Overview blade**.

    ![The Entities portion of the Service Bus Namespace left menu is displayed with the Topics menu item highlighted.](images/image89.png "Service bus entities overview blade")

#### Text Analytics API settings

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the Cognitive Service Text API (e.g. **awhotels-sentiment**) in your resource group.

2. On the left-hand menu of the Text API blade, select **Keys and Endpoint**. You will use these configuration values for creating Function Application settings. 

3. Create a new application setting with the **Name** `TextAnalyticsBaseUrl` and enter the **ENDPOINT** as the **Value**. **Use all lower case alpha characters with no spaces**.

4. Create a new application setting with the **Name** `TextAnalyticsAccountName` and paste the value of the Cognitive Service **Name** into the **Value** field.

5. Create a new application setting with the **Name** `TextAnalyticsAccountKey` and paste the value of **KEY 1** of the Cognitive Service into the **Value** field.

6. Scroll to the top of the function **Application Settings** and select **Save** from the toolbar. Your application settings should now resemble the following (to see the hidden values, select the eye icon in the Value column)

    ![The Application Settings listing for the Function App is shown.](images/2020-08-16-10-07-23.png "Function Application settings")

## Exercise 3: Deploying the App Services

3. Select **Azure Function App (Windows) and click **Next**.

4. Choose the **Subscription** that contains your Function App you provisioned earlier. Expand your **Resource Group** (e.g., **intelligent-analytics**), then select the node for your **Function App** in the tree view to select it and click **Finish**.

    ![In the App Service dialog box, the resource group is expanded and the function app chatprocessor is selected.](images/2019-09-03-15-40-04.png "App Service dialog box")

5. Select **Publish**.

    ![The Azure Function publish dialog box is displayed.](images/vs-publish-function-publish.png "Publish dialog box")

6. When the publish completes, the Output window should indicate success similar to the following:

    ![The Output window is set to show output from Build. Output indicates it is updating files, and that Publish Succeeded.](images/vs-publish-function-output.png "Output window")

    > **Note**: If you receive an error in the Output window, as a result of the publish process failing (The target "MSDeployPublish" does not exist in the project), expand the Properties folder within the Visual Studio project, then delete the PublishProfiles folder. Then repeat steps 1-5 to publish.

### Task 3: Publish the ChatWebApp

1. Within **Visual Studio Solution Explorer**, right-click the ChatWebApp project and select **Publish...** from the context menu.

    ![In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer ChatWebApp sub-menu, Publish is selected.](images/image100.png "Visual Studio Solution Explorer")

2. In the **Publish blade**, select **Azure** and click **Next**. Then select **Azure App Service (Windows)** and click **Next**.

3. In the **App Service** dialog, choose your **Subscription** that contains your Web App you provisioned earlier. Expand your **Resource Group**, **intelligent-analytics**, then select the node for your **Web App** in the tree view to select it. Click **Finish**.

    ![The screen shows the publish folder options. The web app is selected.](images/2019-11-16-13-31-12.png "Azure Web App Publish Options")

4. Select **Publish**.

5. When the publishing is complete, a browser window should appear with content like the following:

    ![The Browser window displays the Contoso Hotels webpage with a Join Chat section that has a username textbox and a chat room selection drop down list.](images/2020-06-29-10-10-20.png "Join chat landing page")

6. **Note**: It may take a couple of minutes for the browser to render. You must use a modern browser like Edge. If the site is opened in Internet Explorer, copy the URL from the address bar, open Edge (that you installed earlier), and navigate to the site with Edge instead.

### Task 4: Testing hotel lobby chat

1. Open a browser instance (Edge is recommended for this web app), and navigate to the deployment URL for your Web App.

    - If you are unsure what this URL is, it can be found in two places:

      - First, you can find it on the **ChatWebApp** document in **Visual Studio**, that was opened when you published the Web App.

        ![In the Visual Studio ChatWebbApp tab, under Summary, the Site URL is displayed.](images/2019-06-20-17-53-33.png "Visual Studio ChatWebbApp tab")

      - Alternatively, this can be found in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) on the **Overview** blade for your **Web App**.

2. Under the **Join Chat** area, enter your username (anything will do).

3. Leave **Hotel Lobby** selected.

4. Select the **Join** button.

5. The Live Chat should appear. Wait for a 1 minute. The first message warms up the system. You should see a message stating you have connected to the chat service and you have joined the session.

   The **connected** message means you have connected to the web application via SignalR.  The **join** message means you have sent a message to the event hub and the function app Event Hub Trigger copied the message to the service bus topic. Also, the web application has received the message using the topic subscription and pushed it the browser client.

   > **Warning**: Failure to see these messages means your configuration could be incorrect and will cause problems in the next exercises.

    ![The Live Chat window displays, showing that it is connected to the chat service.](images/2020-06-29-10-15-14.png "Live Chat window")

    - Open the browser console. You should see similar SignalR messages.

    ![The screenshot shows SignalR debug messages.](images/2020-08-17-08-58-40.png "SignalR Debug Messages")

6. Open another browser tab and navigate to the web site.

7. Enter `HotelLobby` (no spaces), and select **Join**.

8. From either session, fill in the Chat text box and select **Send**. You can try using @ and \# too, just to seed some text for search.

    ![The Live Chat window shows a chat going on between two users.](images/2020-06-29-10-17-13.png "Live Chat window")

9. Debugging Chat Messages

    - Event Hub Message Debugging.
      - Navigate back to the Azure Portal and select your resource group.
      - Select the event hub.
      - Select the your event hub link.  e.g. awchathub.
      - Select the **Process Data** in the left-hand menu item.
      - Select the **Explore** button.

        ![The screenshot shows how to process event hub data.](images/2020-08-16-15-29-27.png "Process Event Hub Data")

      - Select the **Test query** link.  You may have to grant permissions.
        ![The image shows the Test query link highlighted](images/2020-08-16-15-33-01.png "Test query")

        Your chat messages should appear here.  This means your web application and event hub configuration settings are correct. If messages do not show, go back and check your Application Settings. Notice your messages are spread across the different partitions.

        ![The image shows test messages in the event hub.](images/2020-08-16-15-37-22.png "Event hub test messages")

    - Check your function app.

        > **Note**: _Debugging Tips_: If you navigate to the Azure Function Monitor, you can get more clues to any problems. Below is example of the log output. It can take up to 5 minutes for log entries to display.

        - Select your **ProcessChatMessage** function from the list of functions.

        - Select **Monitor** from the left-hand menu.

        ![The image shows the Function App Monitor link highlighted.](images/2020-08-16-16-12-48.png "Function App Monitor Link")

    ![The Azure Function log is shown with the output of an error displayed.](images/2019-11-24-07-23-56.png "Azure Function Monitor Log Example")

    - Check your Service Bus Subscription activity.
      - Navigate back to your service bus overview.  You should see the message count greater than zero. The web application is going to pull these messages and display them in the browser.

    ![The image shows the service bus activity. Message counts are greater than zero.](images/2020-08-16-16-28-44.png "Service bus activity")

10. Test your Stream Analytics Query.

    - Navigate back to your MessageLogger Stream Analytics job.
    - Select the Query item on the left-hand side.
    - Review the Event Hub `Input preview` and the Stream Analytics `Test results`.

    ![The screen shows how to test your Stream Analytics queries. The arrows point to the Query menu item and Test query button.](images/2020-07-02-16-53-08.png "Test your query")

## Exercise 4: Add intelligence

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will implement code to activate multiple cognitive intelligence services that act on the chat messages.

### Task 1: Implement sentiment analysis

In this task, you will add code that enables the Event Processor to invoke the Text Analytics API using the REST API and retrieve a sentiment score (a value between 0.0, negative, and 1.0, positive sentiment) for the text of a chat message.

1. In the **Solution Explorer** in **Visual Studio**, open **ProcessChatMessage.cs** in the **ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction** project.

2. Scroll down to the method **Run**.

3. Uncomment the code for **TODO: 6**. It should look like:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 6 Append sentiment score to chat message object
    if (sentimentMessage.messageType.Equals("chat", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    {
        sentimentMessage.score = await GetSentimentScore(sentimentMessage);
        log.LogInformation("SentimentScore: " + sentimentMessage.score);
    }
    ```

4. Right click on **ChatMessageSentimentProcessFunction** project and select **Build**.
5. Right click on **ChatMessageSentimentProcessFunction** project and select **Publish**. Then click on **Publish**.
6. The new sentiment functionality will be tested in the Concierge Chat application after deploying Language Understanding (LUIS) in the next task

<!--
6. Test your sentiment query by selecting the sentiment query and selecting the `Test selected query` button.  Check your results.  Look at the **score** column. You should have all of the negative chat messages. Sentiment analysis has not been applied just yet. The sentiment analysis will be tested after the Language Understanding configuration has been completed.

    ![The screen shows the ability to test your queries before saving them.](images/2020-07-02-17-01-33.png "Test your queries")

-->

### Task 2: Implement linguistic understanding

What is the hotel guest's intention?

In this task, you will create a LUIS app, publish it, and then enable the Event Processor to invoke LUIS using the `Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Language.LUIS.Runtime` NuGet package. You will be setting up the LUIS model hierarchy and executing these steps.

![The diagram depicts the exercise steps. Create model, train model, test model, publish.](images/2020-06-30-14-22-42.png "LUIS workflow")

1. Using a browser, navigate to <http://www.luis.ai>.  

    > **Note**: If in Exercise 1, Step 12 you created your Luis account in Azure in an European region (e.g. West Europe), user <http://eu.luis.ai> instead. If you selected an Australian region use <http://au.luis.ai>.

2. Select **Login / Sign up**.

3. Sign in using your work account. The new account startup process may take a few minutes. If you are prompted to migrate to the Preview version of the LUIS portal, select **Migrate Later**.

4. Select **Accept** terms button (if this is your first time logging into LUIS).

5. You should be redirected to the **My Apps** list page. Make sure the correct **Subscription** and **Authoring Resource** is selected and then click on **+Create new app for conversation**.

    ![The My Apps table is displayed with the + Create new app button highlighted in the toolbar.](images/2020-08-18-17-39-36.png "Create LUIS app")

6. Complete the **Create a new app** form by providing `awchat` as the name for your LUIS app, and selecting the **English** culture then select **Done**.

    ![In the Create a new app dialog box, the Name field is set to awchat, and Culture is set to English.](images/2020-08-18-17-46-45.png "Create new app")

7. Scroll through the examples of how to create the intents and utterances. Close the dialog.

8. In a moment, your new `awchat` app will appear.

9. Choose **Build** from the toolbar. In the **Intents** pane, select **+ Create** link.

    ![The top toolbar is displayed. The Build menu item is selected.](images/2019-06-20-19-55-55.png "Build Menu Item")

10. In the **Intents** dialog, for the **Intent Name** enter `OrderIn` and select **Done**.

    ![The OrderIn intent has been entered into the Create new intent dialog and the Done button is selected.](images/image118.png "Create a new intent")

11. Select **Entities** from the menu on the left.

    ![The Entities menu item is selected in the left menu.](images/2020-06-28-10-09-17.png "Entities menu")

12. Select **+Create**.

    ![On the Entities screen, the Create new entity button is selected on the toolbar.](images/2020-08-18-17-59-38.png "Create new entity")

13. For the **Entity name**, enter **RoomService**.  Select the **Create** button.

    ![The Add Entity dialog is displayed. Name and Entity Type are set to the preceding values.](images/2020-06-28-08-18-43.png "Add Entity dialog box")

14. Return to the **OrderIn** intent screen to enter utterances.

    ![The OrderIn intent item is selected.](images/2020-06-28-08-31-26.png "Return to OrderIn Intent")

15. In the example input text box, enter the "order a pizza" utterance and **press the Enter key to save your work**.

16. Your newly created pizza utterance is shown below. Select the utterance with your mouse and associate it with the RoomService entity in the dropdown. Upon entity selection, your work will be saved.

    ![The screen shows the order a pizza utterance highlighted and a dropdown menu displaying RoomService entity.](images/2020-06-28-08-36-52.png "Associate the entity")

    Your work is saved automatically.

    ![The order pizza utterance is displayed with associated RoomService entity.](images/2020-06-28-08-40-56.png "Example of saved utterance")
17. Time to train your model.  Select the Train button in the upper right.  You should see the following result:

    ![The picture shows the Train button with a green circle and a message of 'Predictions loaded' displayed.](images/2020-06-28-08-45-49.png "Prediction loaded confirmation")

18. Now, it is time to test your model.  Select the Test button. Type in, "I would like to order a pizza" into the text box and select the `Enter` key. Select the **Inspect** link. You should see a correlation result above to 90% as well as the associated ML entity.

    ![The screen shows the original test phrase and the test results.](images/2020-06-28-08-55-50.png "Inspecting the test results")

    It is important to see a high correlation (above .75) and a resulting ML entity because the chat application needs it in order to send the message to the correct hotel department. Below is the code from the function application that determines if there is an utterance match.

    ![The screen shows the chat processing code and the reason for making sure the entity and intent is returned.](images/2020-06-29-05-10-51.png "Code sample of intent handler")

19. Repeat this process for the following phrases and associate them with the **RoomService** entity:

    - I am hungry
    - order food
    - order a hamburger
    - order a soda
    - order dinner
    - order breakfast
    - order a drink

20. Create a **Housekeeping** entity.

21. Create the following utterances and associate them with the Housekeeping entity:

    - more towels
    - more blankets
    - room too warm
    - room too cold
    - I am cold
    - I am too hot

22. Train and test your model.  Did you get the expected test results?

23. Enter one more utterance, `order a hotdog`. There is some new functionality in LUIS. Notice the predicted label/entity was suggested for you.  Confirm the **RoomService** entity. **Train** your model again.

    ![The screenshot shows the new machine learning prediction for the utterance. The user did not have to select the phrase and associated it with the entity.](images/2020-08-18-19-02-58.png "Machine learning entity prediction")

    ![The screenshot shows the Confirm RoomService option highlighted](images/2020-08-18-19-04-47.png "Confirm RoomService")

24. Click on **Publish** and select **Production Slot**. Click **Done**.

![The screenshot shows the Publish button highlighted.](images/2020-08-18-20-08-05.png "Publish Slot Button")

![The screenshot shows the publishing slot settings. The Production Slot is selected.](images/2020-08-18-20-05-23.png "Production Slot")

25. When the publish process completes, go to **Manage** from the toolbar, then select **Azure Resources** from the left menu. In the **luis-api-namespace** section, the URL is available in the **Example Query** textbox.

    ![The Azure Resources menu item is selected from the left menu and the Example Query URL is shown in a textbox.](images/2020-08-18-19-27-46.png "LUIS Key Information")

26. Open a new tab in your browser. Paste the **Example Query** URL into the address bar and modify the end of the URL (the text following q= ) so it contains the phrase `bring me towels` and press **ENTER**. You should receive output similar to the following. Observe that it correctly identified the intent as **OrderIn** (in this case with a confidence of 0.969854355 or nearly 100%) and the entity as **towels** having an entity type of **Housekeeping:RoomItem** (in this case with a confidence score of 98.9%).

    ![An example of the LUIS call JSON result is displayed.](images/2019-11-24-11-14-17.png "Sample LUIS Response")

27. Go back to the **luis-api-namespace** screen and capture these 3 LUIS values: 

    ```text
    LuisPredictionKey
    LuisBaseUrl
    LuisAppId
    ```

    !["The screenshot shows the LUIS Starter_Key settings. Three application settings are highlighted. LuisPredictionKey, LuisBaseUrl, and LuisAppId"](images/2020-08-18-19-32-28.png "LUIS Application Settings")

28. Go back to your Azure Function App and add those 3 new values you just captured into **Application Settings**. 

    ![Example of Application Settings Configuration for LUIS values](images/luis_appsettings.png "Application Settings Configuration")



29. **Save** your Application Settings. The Event Processor is pre-configured to invoke the LUIS API using the provided App ID and key.

30. Open **Visual Studio** then open **ProcessChatMessage.cs** within the **ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction** project, and navigate to the Run method.

31. Locate **TODO: 7** and uncomment the code:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 7.Respond to chat message intent if appropriate
    var updatedMessageObject = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<MessageType>(updatedMessage);

    // Get your most likely intent based on your message.
    var intent = await GetIntentAndEntities(updatedMessageObject.message);
    await HandleIntent(intent, updatedMessageObject, topicClient);
    ```

32. Take a look at the implementation of both methods if you are curious how the entity and intent information is used to generate an automatic chat message response from a bot.

33. Save the file.

### Task 3: Re-deploy the function application and test

Now that you have added sentiment analysis and language understanding to the solution, you need to re-deploy the apps so you can test out the new functionality.

1. Publish the **ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction** Function App using **Visual Studio** just as you did in [Exercise 4, Task 2](#task-2-publish-the-chatmessagesentimentprocessor-function-app).

2. Open the Hotel Lobby web page. Join a chat in the **Hotel Lobby**.

3. Type a message with a positive sentiment, like `I love this weather`. Observe the **thumbs-up** icon that appears next to the chat message you sent. Next, types something like, `I hate this weather` and observe the **thumbs-down** icon. These are indicators of sentiment (as applied by your solution in real-time).

    ![In the Live Chat window, callouts point to the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons. The 'love this weather' statement produces a thumbs-up icon. Thumbs down for the 'I have this weather'](images/2020-06-29-05-44-34.png "Live Chat window")

4. Next, try ordering some items from room service, like `bring me towels` and `order a pizza`. Observe that you get a response from the **ConciergeBot**, and that the reply indicates whether your request was sent to **Housekeeping** or **Room Service**, depending on whether the item ordered was a room or food item.

    ![In the chat window, Tim is having a conversation with a ConciergeBot. He asks for towels, and the ConciergeBot says they are forwarding the request to Housekeeping.](images/2020-06-29-05-47-15.png "Live Chat window")

<!--
## Exercise 5: Building the Power BI dashboard

Duration: 30 minutes

Now that you have the solution deployed and exchanging messages, you can build a Power BI dashboard that monitors the sentiments of the messages being exchanged in real time. The following steps walk through the creation of the dashboard.

### Task 1: Provision Power BI

If you do not already have a Power BI account:

1. Go to <https://powerbi.microsoft.com/features/>.

2. Scroll down until you see the **Try Power BI for free!** section of the page, and select the **Try Free** button.

    ![Screenshot of the Power BI Try for free section.](images/setup3.png "Power BI Try for free section")

3. On the page, enter your work email address (which should be the same account as the one you use for your Azure subscription), and select **Sign up**.

    ![The Get started page has a field for entering your work email address.](images/setup4.png "Get started page")

4. Follow the on-screen prompts, and your Power BI environment should be ready within minutes. You can always return to it via <https://app.powerbi.com/>.

### Task 2: Create the static dashboard

1. Sign in to your Power BI subscription (<https://app.powerbi.com>).

2. Select **My Workspace** on the left-hand menu, then select the **Datasets** tab.

    ![In the Power BI window, on the left menu, My Workspace is selected. In the right pane, the Datasets tab is selected.](images/image140.png "Power BI window")

3. Under the **Datasets** list, select the **Messages** dataset.

    ![On the Datasets tab, the Messages dataset is highlighted in the table.](images/image141.png "Datasets tab")

4. Select the **Create Report** button under the **Actions** column.

    ![On the Datasets tab, under the Actions column, the Create Report button is selected.](images/image142.png "Datasets tab")

5. On the **Visualizations** palette, select **Gauge** to create a semi-circular gauge.

    ![On the Visualizations palette, the Gauge icon is highlighted.](images/image143.png "Visualizations palette")

6. In the **Fields** listing, select and drag the **score** field and drop it onto the **Value** field.

    ![In the Visualizations blade, the Gauge is selected. From the Fields blade under Messages, the score check box is selected. An arrow points from this to the Value field in the Visualizations pane indicating a drag and drop operation. Score is now listed as the Value in Visualizations.](images/image144.png "Visualizations and Fields listings")

7. Select the drop-down menu that appears where you dropped score and select **Average**.

    ![Average is selected from the Value drop down box in the Visualizations blade.](images/image145.png "Drop-down menu")

8. You now should have a gauge that shows the average sentiment for all the data collected so far, which should look similar to the following:

    ![A semi-circle gauge graph displays for Average of score, which is 0.62.](images/image146.png "Gauge graph")

9. From the **File** menu, select **Save** to save your visualization to a new report.

    ![On the toolbar the File menu is expanded and Save (Save this report) is selected.](images/image147.png "File menu")

10. Enter `ChatSentiment` for the report name, and select **Save**.

    ![In the Save your report window, ChatSentiment is typed in as the name of the report.](images/image148.png "Save your report window")

### Task 3: Create the real-time dashboard

This gauge is currently a static visualization. You will use the report just created to seed a dashboard whose visualizations update as new messages arrive.

1. Select the **Pin Live Page** item located on the toolbar.

    ![On the toolbar, the Pin Live Page button is selected.](images/image149.png "Gauge control menu bar")

2. Select New **dashboard**, enter `Real-time Sentiment` as the name, and select **Pin Live**.

    ![On the Pin to dashboard dialog box, on the left, a Preview of the ChatSentiment Gauge graph displays. On the right, under Where would you like to pin to, the New dashboard radio button is selected.](images/2019-06-21-09-41-59.png "Pin to dashboard dialog box")

3. Return to the **My Workspace** page, and select your newly created dashboard from the list of dashboards.

    ![My Workspace dashboards list is displayed with the Real-time Sentiment dashboard selected.](images/image151.png 'My Workspace dashboards')

4. Real-time dashboards are created in Power BI using the Q&A feature, by typing in a question to visualize in the space provided. In the **Ask a question about your data** field, enter: `average score created between yesterday and today`.

    ![The input text box placeholder texts states Ask a question about your data.](images/2019-03-21-10-26-35.png "Ask a question about your data")

    ![average score created between yesterday and today is typed in the Ask question about your data textbox. An average of score (0.62) displays below.](images/image152.png "Ask question about your data field")

5. Next, convert this to a Gauge chart by expanding the **Visualizations** palette at right, and selecting on the **Gauge** control. You will need to set the **New Q&A experience** to **Off** in order to see the **Visualizations** palette. This switch is on the toolbar on the right-hand side.

    ![The Visualizations palette expand button is selected.](images/image153.png "Visualizations palette")

6. In the **Visualizations** palette, select the **Gauge** control. Select the **Format** (paint roller) icon and expand the **Gauge axis** section. Format the Gauge axis so it ranges between **0.0** and **1.0** and has a **target** (indicator) set at **0.5**.

    ![On the Visualizations palette, the Gauge graph icon is selected. Beneath that, the brush icon is selected. Under Gauge axis, the following values are defined: Min, 0. Max, 1.0. Target, 0.5.](images/image154.png "Visualizations list")

7. Your gauge should now look similar to the following:

    ![The Gauge graph for average score created between yesterday and today displays with an average of score of 0.62.](images/image155.png "Gauge graph")

8. In the top-right corner, select **Pin visual**.

    ![Pin visual option from the toolbar.](images/image156.png "Pin visual option")

9. In the dialog that appears, select the dashboard you recently created and select **Pin**.

    ![On the Pin to dashboard dialog box, on the left, a Preview of the Gauge graph displays. On the right, under Where would you like to pin to, the Existing dashboard radio button is selected.](images/image157.png "Pin to dashboard dialog box")

10. In the list of dashboards, select your **Real-time Sentiment** dashboard. Your new gauge should appear next to your original gauge. If the original gauge fills the whole screen, you may need to scroll down to see the new gauge. You can delete the original gauge if you prefer. (Select the top of the visualization, then ellipses that appear, and then, the trash can icon.)

    ![Two Average of score Gauge graphs display, and both share the same data.](images/image158.png "Gauge graphs")

11. Navigate to the chat website you deployed and send some messages and observe how the sentiment gauge updates with moments of you sending chat messages.

### Task 4: Add a trending sentiment chart to the dashboard

The sentiment visualization you created is great for getting a sense of sentiment as of this moment. However, First Up Consultants wishes to view sentiment over time for historical reference and to see whether overall sentiment is trending one way or another. To do this, we will use the tumbling window query output from Stream Analytics to display this data in a line chart.

1. While still in **Power BI**, select **My Workspace** once again, then select the **Datasets** tab. You should see the **TrendingSentiment** dataset dynamically created by Stream Analytics. Select the **Create Report** action.

    ![Go to My Workspace, then the Datasets tab, the TrendingSentiment dataset is listed, the Create Report icon is selected next to this dataset.](images/power-bi-trendingsentiment-dataset.png "Power BI Datasets")

2. Select the **Line chart** visualization.

    ![In the Visualizations palette, the Line chart visualization is selected.](images/power-bi-line-chart-visualization.png "Power BI Line Chart")

3. Drag the **average** field to the **Values** setting, and **snapshot** to **Axis**.

    ![Arrows indicating drag and drop operations show average in the Values field and snapshot in the Axis field.](images/power-bi-line-chart-settings.png "Power BI Line Chart")

4. Resize the line chart and observe how the average sentiment is tracked over time.

    ![Screenshot of the line chart displaying trending sentiment over time.](images/power-bi-trending-sentiment-chart.png "Power BI Line Chart")

5. Select **Save this report** on the top of the page. Name the report `Trending Sentiment` when prompted.

## Exercise 5: Enabling search indexing

Duration: 30 minutes

Now that you have primed the system with some messages, you will create a Search Index and an Indexer in Azure Search upon the messages that are collected in Azure Cosmos DB.

### Task 1: Verifying message archive

Before going further, a good thing to check is whether messages are being written to Azure Cosmos DB from the Stream Analytics Job.

1. In the **Azure Portal**, navigate to your **Azure Cosmos DB account**.

2. On the left-hand menu, select **Data Explorer**.

    ![The Data Explorer icon from the Cosmos DB left menu.](images/image160.png "Data explorer menu")

3. Under the **awhotels** Cosmos DB, select **messagestore**, then **Items**. You should see some data here.

    ![In Data Explorer, the awhotels, and messagestore items are expanded. The Items item below messagestore is selected.](images/2020-06-30-19-31-44.png "Documents selected in Data Explorer")

4. If you want to peek at the message contents, select any item in the listing.

    ![A list of messages is displayed with one selected, the JSON message displayed to the right.](images/2020-06-30-15-56-18.png "Cosmos DB Item Contents")

    > **Note**: If you don't see messages, then check for errors in MessageLogger, Outputs, Cosmos DB.  If you have to delete the collection and recreate them, make sure to stop and start the MessageLogger.  Test the connection.

    ![The output details of a Cosmos DB error is shown.](images/2019-03-21-13-45-17.png "CosmoDB output details error")

### Task 2: Creating the index and indexer

1. Select **Resource Groups** from the left menu, then select the **intelligent-analytics** resource group.

2. Select your **Search service** instance from the list.

    ![The conciergeplusapp search service icon is displayed.](images/2019-03-21-13-59-10.png "ChatSearchApi icon")

3. Select **Import data**.

    ![The Search Service toolbar has the Import data item selected.](images/image163.png "Intelligent-analytics resource group")

4. On the **Import data** blade, select **Connect to your data**.

    ![The import data blade is shown with the Connect to your data selected.](images/2019-03-21-14-00-40.png "Import data blade")

5. For **Data Source**, select **Cosmos DB** from the dropdown.

6. Enter `messagestore` for the **Data Source Name**.

7. **Cosmo DB account**: Select the **Choose an existing connection**, and select the **awhotelcosmosdb-namespace** database. This will auto-populate the connection string.

8. For **Database**, select your **awhotels** database.

9. For **Collection**, choose your **messagestore** collection.

    ![Import data form is displayed populated with the preceding values.](images/2019-03-21-14-12-53.png "Display all of the fields")

10. Select the **Next: Add cognitive search** button.

    ![The Next: Add cognitive search button.](images/2019-03-21-14-17-35.png "Next button")

    Select **Skip to: Customize target index**.

    ![The Skip to: Customize target index button.](images/2019-03-21-14-20-45.png "Skip to Customize target index")

11. Select **Customize target index**, and observe that the field list has been pre-populated for you based on data in the collection.

12. Enter `chatmessages` for the name of the index. Capture this value for later web application configuration.

13. Set the Key to **id**

    ![The Key field is set to id.](images/image167.png 'Key ID field')

14. Select the **Retrievable** check box for the following fields: **message, createDate**, and **username** (id will be selected automatically). Only these fields will be returned in query results.

15. Select the **Filterable** check box for **createDate, username**, and **sessionId**. These fields can be used with the filter clause only (not used by this Tutorial, but useful to have).

16. Select the **Sortable** check box for **createDate**, **username**, and **sessionId**. These fields can be used to sort the results of a query.

17. Select the **Searchable** check box for **message**. Only this field will be indexed for full text search.

18. Confirm your grid looks similar to the following, and select **Next: Create an Indexer**.

    ![On the Import data blade, the Customize target index tab is selected. The Index blade fields and check boxes are set to previously mentioned settings.](images/2019-03-21-14-26-25.png "Import data and Index blades")

19. On the **Create an Indexer** blade, enter `messages-indexer` as the name.

20. Set the **Schedule** toggle to **Custom**.

21. Enter an **interval** of **5** minutes (the minimum allowed).

22. Keep the **Start time** to the default value of **today's date**.

23. The description and other fields can be ignored.

24. Select **Submit** to begin importing data using your indexer.

25. You should test your index and configure it to be searchable by client applications. After a few moments, examine the Indexers tile for the status of the Indexer. You should see your messages indexed.

    ![In the Search service Overview screen, the Indexes tab is selected. The chatmessages index is listed and displays number of documents indexed.](images/2019-03-21-16-22-06.png "Documents Indexed")

    Select the **chatmessages** index.  You can test the searches by entering values in the **Query string** text box. Enter `search=pizza` into the Query string box and select **Search**.

    ![Testing the chat message search, the term search=test is entered in the Query string textbox and the results of the search are shown in JSON format."](images/search_pizza.png "Testing Search Indexes")

    Select the **CORS** tab. Select **All** for the option. Press the Save button.

    ![On the Index screen, the CORS tab is selected. The Allowed origin type is set to All.](images/2019-06-22-17-59-36.png "CORS Options")

    > **Note**: The **All** setting allows search requests from other client applications to successfully execute. For a production application, you would choose the **Custom** option and enter the domain you will be receiving requests from.

26. We now need to capture the index query api key and endpoint for the Azure Web App configuration. On the **Search Service** blade, go to **Overview** and copy the URL value on the right side (e.g., <https://conciergeplusappsearchth.search.windows.net>)

     ![The Azure Search Service overview is displayed. On the right hand side, the Url value is highlighted.](images/2019-09-08-15-35-46.png "Search Service URL Displayed")

27. Select **Keys** on the left-hand menu. Capture the **Primary admin key**. The value will be used for the ChatSearchApiKey.

    ![The Azure Cognitive Search Service key configuration screen is displayed.](images/2020-06-30-16-12-38.png "Display Search Keys")

### Task 3: Update the Chat Web App Configuration

1. Navigate to your Web App resource and select **Configuration**.

2. We are going to add the following values. You will use the Search service endpoint and key (that you captured earlier) as the values for ChatSearchApiBase and ChatSearchApiKey respectively.

    ```text
    ChatSearchApiBase
    ChatSearchApiKey
    ChatSearchApiIndexName (e.g. chatmessages)
    ```

3. Save the web application configuration.

### Task 4: Re-publish web app

1. Publish the updated **ChatWebApp** using Visual Studio, as was shown previously in [Exercise 4, Task 3](#task-3-publish-the-chatwebapp).

2. When the publishing is complete, a browser window should appear.

3. Navigate to the **Search** tab on the deployed Web App and try searching for chat messages.

    ![In the Search Messages box, in the Search messages for text box, Hi is typed. Below that, 32 results have been found.](images/2020-06-30-18-55-16.png "Search Messages box")

## Exercise 6: Add a bot using Bot service and QnA Maker

Duration: 30 minutes

At this point, you have created a real-time chat service in Azure, allowing people to interact with one another. Now we will build a bot that will automatically respond to user questions, helping take the load off the hotel staff.

### Task 1: Create a QnA service instance in Azure

Microsoft's QnAMaker is a Cognitive Service tool that uses your existing content to build and train a simple question and answer bot that responds to users in a natural, conversational way.
