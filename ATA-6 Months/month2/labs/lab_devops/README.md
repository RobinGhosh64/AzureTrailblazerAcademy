# Azure DevOps Hands-on Lab - Step by Step Guide

## Overview: 

In this lab, you will learn how to use Azure DevOps to create a CI/CD pipeline. This project will guide you through creating the pipeline to automatically build, verify, and deploy your souce code changes into Azure. 

**Note:** When you're done, remember to **Stop** your VM from the Azure Portal. And when you're really, really done, delete the resources you created for this lab.

## Prerequisite: Create a Visual Studio 2019 virtual machine from the Azure Portal. 
 
1.	In a browser, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), sign in, and click on **Create a resource**.
1.	In the **Search the Marketplace** search box, type **Visual Studio** then select **Visual Studio 2019 Latest**. 
1.	In the **Select a software plan** dropdown list, select **Visual Studio Community (latest release) on Windows Server 2019 (x64)**, then click **Create**.
1.	Complete the creation with the following information. Leave the defaults for the other options. 

    - Select or create a new resource group
    - Give your VM a name, such as vmatalab plus your initials (such as vmatalabjb)
    - Provide an admin **Username** and **Password**
    - Leave the **Public inbound ports** and **Select inbound ports** settings as they are.
    - Click **Review + create**

    **Recommendation:** Use the **D4_v3** VM size rather than a smaller, slower one. You will appreciate the faster speed when walking through the steps that involve Visual Studio. Just be sure to shut down the VM from the Azure portal (or delete it altogether) when you finish the lab. This VM costs around $0.38 an hour while it is not stopped from the Azure portal.
 
1.	After validation completes, press **Create**. 
 
It will take several minutes for the deployment to complete. 

  
## Task 1. Connect to the VM, download the sample project from GitHub, and open Visual Studio. 
 
1. Once the deployment is complete (it will take a few minutes), click **Go to resource**. 
    
    ![](images/gotoresource.png)
 
1.	Click (1) **Connect**, click (2) **RDP**, then on the next page, click (3) **Download RDP file**
    
    ![](images/connecttovm5.png)
 
1. 	Open the downloaded RDP file, and connect to the VM. 
 
    ![](images/connecttovm2.png)
 
1.	When prompted to enter your credentials, 
    - (1) Click **More choices**
    - (2) Click **Use a different account**
    - (3) Enter the **User name** and **Password** you provided when you created the VM
    - (4) Click **OK**, then clickk **OK** in the next dialog box.
    
        ![](images/connecttovm6.png)
  
1. In the **Remote Desktop Connection** dialog box, click (1) **Don't ask me again for connections to this computer** then click (2) **Yes**

    ![](images/connecttovm4.png)

1. Once you're connected to the VM, if prompted, choose **No** to the **Networks** prompt.

    ![](images/networks.png)

1. Inside the VM, open **Internet Explorer** and download the sample project to the VM's C: drive from GitHub: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dotnet-sqldb-tutorial/archive/master.zip
 
    ![](images/downloadfromgithub.png)
 
1. Create a folder to hold the project, (for example, **c:\HOL\ToDoApp**), and extract the files into it.
 
    ![](images/copyfilestoholfolder.png)

1. Open the solution in **Visual Studio 2019** by double-clicking on the extracted solution file **DotNetAppSqlDb.sln**.  
1. When prompted for credentials you can use your corporate credentials, your Microsoft account, or create them on the fly. 
1. Once Visual Studio opens it should look something like this.

    ![](images/vswithsolutionexplorer.png)
 
## Task 2. Publish the application to Azure
 
1. Right click on the project file **DotNetAppSqlDb** (1), and click **Publish…** (2) 

    ![](images/clickprojectandpublish.png)

1. In the **Publish – Where are you publishing today?** wizard, click **Next** to select **Azure**, then click **Next** to select **Azure App Service (Windows)**.

    - (1) Then click **+ Create a new Azure App Service…**
    - (2) In the **App Service (Windows)** window that opens, select the **Subscription** and **Resource Group** you’re using for this lab 
    - (3) Click **New…** to the right of **Hosting Plan**
    - (4) In the **Hosting Plan Create new** window that opens, ensure the **Location** is the same as your other resources in this resource group (having resources in the same region helps with applicaiton performance)
    - (5) Click OK in the **Hosting Plan - Create new** window.

        ![](images/publishwizard1.png)

1. This brings you back to the **App Service (Windows)** window. Click **Create** to create the App Service Plan. It can take a couple of minutes to complete.
 
    ![](images/appservicewindows.png)

1. Once the **App Service Plan** is created you will automatically be returned to the **Publish Select existing or create a new Azure App Service** window. Click **Finish**
 
    ![](images/publishfinish.png)

        ![](images/publishconfiguresql3.png)

1. In the **SQL Server – Create new** window
    - (1) Give the **Database server name** a unique name
    - (2) Use the default or select a different **Location**. For better performance, it's good to have the database in the same region as the App Service
    - (3) Provide a database **Administrator username** and **Administrator password**. *You will need this password again in a few minutes.*
    - (4) Click **OK** 

        ![](images/publishconfiguresql4.png)
  
1. Click **Create** in the **Azure SQL Database - Create new window** to create the database and close the window. It will take a few minutes to create the database. 

1. Back in the **Configure Azure SQL Database** wizard click **Cancel** to close the wizard. (For simplicity's sake during this lab, we will use the database admin credentials in our database connection string.) 
 
    ![](images/publishconfiguresql5.png)

1. Update the **Database connection string** in the application's **Web.config** file. 
    - (1) In **Internet Explorer** go to your resource group in the **Azure Portal** 
    - (2) Click on the **SQL database** name

        ![](images/changeconnectionstring1.png)
    
    - (3) Click on **Connection strings** in the left navigation bar, then copy the entire **ADO.NET (SQL authentication)** connection string. 

        ![](images/changeconnectionstring2.png)

    - (4) In **Visual Studio** open the **Web.config** file and replace the existing value of the **connectionString** with the value you copied from the Azure Portal. 

        ![](images/changeconnectionstring3.png)

    - (5) Replace the **{your_password}** placeholder in the connection string with the password of the database administrator you created a few steps ago. 
    - (6) **Save** the **Web.config** file then **close its tab** in the editor. 

1. In the **Publish - Deploy your app to a folder...** tab in Visual Studio, click **Publish**

    ![](images/publishtoazure1.png)

1. In the web browser that opens, verify that the site looks correct. 

    ![](images/runningapp2.png)

    ![](images/createrelease4.png)

### You need to give your Release pipeline the ability to deploy to Azure resources. There are two options.
1. Option 1) 
    - With **Dev Environment** selected on the left, click on the **Azure subscription** dropdown box on the right. If you see the Subscription you used when you created your App Service from Visual Studio, select it. Click Authorize (it's to the right of the dropdown box -- you may have to zoom way out in the browser window to see it). Then select **App type** **"Web App on Windows"** then select your app service in the App service name dropdown box. The window should look something like this: (Your **App service name** will have a different ending). 
        ![](images/createrelease5.png)
    - Click **Save** and then **OK** 
1. Option 2) 
    - If you didn't see your Subscription in Option 1, you will need to use a Service Principal. (FYI, documentation for Service Principal is located here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)
    - **Right click** on **Project Settings** in the lower left of the navigation pane then select **Open in new tab** 

        ![](images/createrelease6.png)
    
    - In the new tab, click on **Service Connections** in the navigation pane
    
        ![](images/createrelease7.png)
    
    - Click on **New service connection**, click on **Azure Resource Manager** then click **Next**. 
    
        ![](images/createrelease8.png)
    
    - In the **New Azure service connection** window that opens up, select **Service principal (automatic)** then click **Next**
    - In the next window, set the **Scope level** to **Subscription**, provide a **Resource group** name and provide a **Service connection name**. Then click **Save**.
    
        ![](images/createrelease9.png)
    
    - Once the service connection is saved, close the browser tab and return to the tab that has your release definition.
    - Click on the circular arrow beside the dropdown box for **Azure subscription**, and beside the **App service name**. This will refresh the lists. In the **Azure subscription** list, select your Service connection, then select your **App service name**.
    
        ![](images/createrelease12.png)

**Now you're finshed with setting up the pipeline's connection to Azure. Continue editing the release definition.**

1. Click on the **Options** tab then **Integrations**. Check **Report deployment status to the repository host Stages**, **Report deployment status to Work**, **Report deployment status to Boards** and within that select **Deployment type** of **Development**. Then click **Save** then **OK**.
    
    ![](images/createrelease13.png)

1. Click on the **Pipeline** tab, then on **Pre-deployment conditions** (lightning bolt with a check mark)

    ![](images/createrelease14.png)

1. Enable **Pre-deployment approvals** by clicking on the toggle switch then search for yourself in the **Approvers** box. Close the window by clicking the X in the top right corner of the **Pre-deployment conditions** window.

    ![](images/createrelease15.png)

1. Click **Save** in the upper right of the  release definition window then click **OK**. 
1. In the upper right corner, click on **Create release**.

    ![](images/createrelease16.png)

1. In **Create a new release** window, click **Create**
1. You will see the message **Release Release-1 has been created** near the top of the window. Click on the **Release-1** link to view the status of the pipeline
1. The **Dev Environment** stage is pending approval before it can be deployed. Click on the **Dev Environment stage**. Do not click on Approve yet. 
1. In the window that opens, look at the **Summary**, **Commits**, and **Work Items** tabs. In the **Work Items** tab you'll see the Bug linked to your release. Click the X in the upper right cornder of the window.

    ![](images/createrelease17.png)  

1. Click on the **Approve** button and the next **Approve** button to allow the release to continue. Click the **X** in the upper right of the window. You'll see the deployment to the **Dev Environment** is **In progress**

    ![](images/createrelease18.png)

1. After the deployment completes, click on the **Dev Environment**. You should see something like the screen below.

    ![](images/createrelease19.png)

1. If you open the web app now, you should be able to see the change made ("Training App") which was applied through the pipeline. 

### Freestyle time

1. Make another change in Visual Studio and push the changes up to Azure DevOps. Then watch the Build pipeline run, followed by the Release pipeline. Approve the release and verify the website is updated correctly. Also poke around in the various parts of the completed Release screens. 
 
 
## Reminder: When you're done, remember to Stop your VM from the Azure Portal. And when you're really, really done, delete the resources you created for this lab. The easiest way is to delete your entire resource group.
