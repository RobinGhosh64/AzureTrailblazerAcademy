# Azure IaaS Lab

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Azure subscription
- Resource Group to deploy Azure services

## Reference Architecture  
Below is a big picture of a comon design architecture for a 3 Tier Application deployed in a highly available architecture.

For this lab we are going to deploy something simular to the business tier of this application. Our focus is to deploy a VM Scale Set behind an Azure Load Balancer.

** Notes: We will not focus on networking in this lab. Networking will be covered later in the course work.

## Step 1: Create a Resource Group
1. In the Azure Portal, search for **Resource Groups**
2. Click on the **Create** button
3. Fill out the **Basics** tab as follows:
- **Subscription:** Choose your subscription
- **Resource Group:** Provide a unique name like **ata-\<username\>-rg
- **Region:** EastUS

4. Click the **Next: Review + Create** button
5. Click the **Create** button

## Step 2: Deploy a VM Scale Set

1. In the Azure Portal, search for **Virtual machine scale sets**
2. Click on the **Add** button
3. Fill out the **Basics** tab as follows:
- **Subscription:** Choose your subscription
- **Resource Group:** Select the Resource Group you created for this lab.
- **Virtual Machine Scale Set Name:** Choose a unique name for the VM. Ex: ata-\<username\>-ssvm
- **Region:** East US
- **Availability zone:** Zone 1,2,3
- **Image:** Windows Server 2019 Datacenter
- **Azure Spot Instance:** No
- **Size:** Standard D2s v3

4. Click the **Next: Disks** button
5. Leave everything as default and click the **Next: Networking** button
6. Fill out **Networking** tab as follows:

- **Virtual Network:** If there is no current Virtual Network in the Subscirption and Region then it will create a new one. This is fine for this excersice being we aren't focusing on the network.
- **Network interface:** Leave this as the default
- **Use a load balancer:** Change this option to Yes to create a new load balancer
- Leave the default options to create a Azure Load Balancer

7. CLick the **Next: Scaling** button
8. Fill out **Scaling** tab as follows:  

- **Initial instance count:** 3
- **Scaling policy:** Manual
- **Scal-in policy:** Default

7. Click the **Next: Management** button
8. Inside the **Management** tab:

- **Upgrade mode:** Manual - Existing instances must be manually upgraded
- **Boot diagnostics:** Enable with managed storage account (recommended)
- Leave everything else as default

9. Click the **Next: Health** button
10. Fillout the **Health** tab as follows:  

- **Monitor applicaton health:** Enabled
- Leave everything else as default

11. Click on the **Next: Advanced** button
11. Leave everything as default and click on the **Next: Tags** button
12. Enter any custom tags (optional) and click the **Next: Review + Create** button
12. Click the **Create** button

## Step 3: Deploy the website

We will utilize the PowerShell DSC extension to deploy a simple website to our scale set:

1. In the portal click on the **Cloud Shell** icon and make sure your in PowerShell mode

<img src="./images/powershell-portal.PNG" alt="Cloud Shell"  Width="900">

2. Inside the cloud shell run the following command to download the needed script:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/AzureTrailblazerAcademy/master/month1/labs/lab_IaaS/scripts/add_website.ps1 > add_website.ps1
```

3. After that download run the following command to install the PowerShell DSC extension:

```
./add_website.ps1 -RGNAME \<ResourceGroupName\> -ScaleSetName \<NameofScaleSet\>
```

4. Once the command completes close out of the Cloud Shell and go back to the Portal

5. In the Azure Portal, search for **Virtual machine scale sets**

6. Click on the Virtual machine scale set you create previously and click on the "Extension" tab. Verify that the DSC extention has been deployed.

7. Clcik on the **Intances** tab. Once the DSC script finished the health will go to healthy. If it doesn't show healthy wait 5 minutes and refresh the view.

## Step 4: Allow External Port 80

In order for us to connect ot the website we will now need to allow port 80 from any location to be able to reach out those Virtual Machines inside the VM Scale Set. Follow steps below to open TCP port 80.

1. While still on the Scale Set Resource blade go to the **Networking** tab.

2. Click on add **Inbound Port Rule** and fill in the following:

- **Destination Port Ranges:** 80
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Name:** Allow 80
- Leave the rest of the option as default and click on **Add**

**Note:** It will take up to 5 minutes for the NSG rule to take affect. 

3. After being patient open the **Overview** tab and take note of the Pubic IP

4. Open an additional tab and go to http://publicIP
