# Cloud-native applications - Infrastructure edition hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

This hands-on lab is designed to guide you through the process of building and deploying Docker images to the Kubernetes platform hosted on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS), in addition to learning how to work with dynamic service discovery, service scale-out, and high-availability.

At the end of this lab, you will be better able to build and deploy containerized applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and perform common DevOps procedures.

## Overview

Fabrikam Medical Conferences (FabMedical) provides conference website services tailored to the medical community. They are refactoring their application code, based on node.js, so that it can run as a Docker application, and want to implement a POC that will help them get familiar with the development process, lifecycle of deployment, and critical aspects of the hosting environment. They will be deploying their applications to Azure Kubernetes Service and want to learn how to deploy containers in a dynamically load-balanced manner, discover containers, and scale them on demand.

In this hands-on lab, you will assist with completing this POC with a subset of the application codebase. You will create a build agent based on Linux, and an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster for running deployed applications. You will be helping them to complete the Docker setup for their application, test locally, push to an image repository, deploy to the cluster, and test load-balancing and scale.

> **Important**: Most Azure resources require unique names. Throughout these steps, you will see the word "SUFFIX" as part of resource names. You should replace this with a unique handle (like your Microsoft Account email prefix) to ensure unique names for resources.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

The solution will use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which means that the container cluster topology is provisioned according to the number of requested nodes. The proposed containers deployed to the cluster are illustrated below with Cosmos DB as a managed service:

![A diagram showing the solution, using Azure Kubernetes Service with a Cosmos DB back end.](images/solution-topology.png "Solution architecture diagram")

Each tenant will have the following containers:

- **Conference Web site**: The Single-Page Application (SPA) application that will use configuration settings to handle custom styles for the tenant.

- **Admin Web site**: The Single-Page Application (SPA) application that conference owners use to manage conference configuration details, manage attendee registrations, manage campaigns, and communicate with attendees.

- **Registration service**: The API that handles all registration activities creating new conference registrations with the appropriate package selections and associated cost.

- **Email service**: The API that handles email notifications to conference attendees during registration, or when the conference owners choose to engage the attendees through their admin site.

- **Config service**: The API that handles conference configuration settings such as dates, locations, pricing tables, early-bird specials, countdowns, and related.

- **Content service**: The API that handles content for the conference such as speakers, sessions, workshops, and sponsors.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

   - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work.

   - To complete this lab, ensure your account has the following roles:

     - The [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner)
       built-in role for the Azure Subscription you will use.

     - Is a [Member](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#member-and-guest-users) user in the Azure AD tenant you will use. (Guest users will not have the necessary permissions.)
  
   - You must have enough cores available in your subscription to create the build agent and Azure Kubernetes Service cluster in Before the Hands-on Lab. You will need eight cores if following the exact instructions in the lab, or more if you choose additional cluster nodes or larger VM sizes. If you execute the steps required before the lab, you will be able to see if you need to request more cores in your sub.

2. Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

   - A browser, preferably Chrome for consistency with the lab implementation tests.

3. An account in Microsoft [GitHub](https://github.com).

4. You will install other tools throughout the exercises.

> **Very important**: You should be typing all the commands as they appear in the guide. Do not try to copy and paste to your command windows or other documents when instructed to enter the information shown in this document, except where explicitly stated in this document. There can be issues with Copy and Paste that result in errors, execution of instructions, or creation of file content.

## Before the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 60 minutes

You should follow all of the steps provided in this section _before_ taking part in the hands-on lab ahead of time as some of these steps take time.

### Task 1: Setup Azure Cloud Shell

1. Open a cloud shell by selecting the cloud shell icon in the menu bar.

   ![The cloud shell icon is highlighted on the menu bar.](images/b4-image35.png "Cloud Shell")

2. The cloud shell opens in the browser window. Choose **Bash** if prompted or use the left-hand dropdown on the shell menu bar to choose **Bash** from the dropdown (as shown). If prompted, select **Confirm**.

   ![This is a screenshot of the cloud shell opened in a browser window. Bash was selected.](images/b4-image36.png "Cloud Shell Bash Window")

3. You should make sure to set your default subscription correctly. To view your current subscription type:

   ```bash
   az account show
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, az account show has been typed and run at the command prompt. Some subscription information is visible in the window, and some information is obscured.](images/b4-image37.png "Bash Shell AZ Account Show")

4. To set your default subscription to something other than the current selection, type the following, replacing {id} with the desired subscription id value:

   ```bash
   az account set --subscription {id}
   ```

> **Note**: To list all of your subscriptions, type:

   ```bash
   az account list
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, az account list has been typed and run at the command prompt. Some subscription information is visible in the window, and some information is obscured.](images/b4-image38.png "Bash AZ Account List")

### Task 2: Download Starter Files

In this task, you use `git` to copy the lab content to your cloud shell so that the lab starter files will be available.

> **Note**: If you don't have a cloud shell available, refer back to [Task 1: Setup Azure Cloud Shell](#task-1-setup-azure-cloud-shell).

1. Type the following command and press `<ENTER>`:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/AzureTrailblazerAcademy.git
   ```

   > **Note**: If you do not have enough free space, you may need to remove extra files from your cloud shell environment.  Try running `azcopy jobs clean` to remove any `azcopy` jobs and data you do not need.

2. The lab files download.

   ![In this screenshot of a Bash window, git clone has been typed and run at the command prompt. The output from git clone is shown.](images/b4-2019-09-30_21-25-06.png "Bash Git Clone")

3. We do not need the `.git` folder, and later steps will be less complex if we remove it. Run this command:

   ```bash
   rm -rf AzureTrailblazerAcademy/.git
   ```

### Task 3: Resource Group

Create an Azure Resource Group to hold most of the resources that you create in this hands-on lab. This approach makes it easier to clean up later.

1. In your cloud shell window, you type a command similar to the following command, be sure to replace the tokens:

   > **Note**: If you don't have a cloud shell available, refer back to [Task 1: Setup Azure Cloud Shell](#task-1-setup-azure-cloud-shell).

   ```bash
   az group create -l '[LOCATION]' -n 'fabmedical-[SUFFIX]'
   ```

   - **Suffix:** Throughout the lab, suffix should be used to make resources unique, like your email prefix or your first initial and last name.

   - **Location:** Choose a region where all Azure Container Registry SKUs have to be available, which is currently: Canada Central, Canada East, North Central US, Central US, South Central US, East US, East US 2, West US, West US 2, West Central US, France Central, UK South, UK West, North Europe, West Europe, Australia East, Australia Southeast, Brazil South, Central India, South India, Japan East, Japan West, Korea Central, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and remember this for future steps so that the resources you create in Azure are all kept within the same region.

   Example:

   ```bash
   az group create -l 'west us' -n 'fabmedical-sol'
   ```

2. When this completes, the Azure Portal shows your Resource Group.

   ![In this screenshot of the Azure Portal, the fabmedical-sol Resource group is listed.](images/b4-image8.png "Fabmedical Resource Groups")

### Task 4: Create an SSH key

You create VMs during the upcoming exercises. In this section, you create an SSH key to access the VMs securely.

1. From the cloud shell command line, enter the following command to ensure that a directory for the SSH keys exists. You can ignore any errors you see in the output.

   > **Note**: If you don't have a cloud shell available, refer back to [Task 1: Setup Azure Cloud Shell](#task-1-setup-azure-cloud-shell).

   ```bash
   mkdir .ssh
   ```

2. From the cloud shell command line, enter the following command to generate an SSH key pair. You can replace `admin` with your preferred name or handle.

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t RSA -b 2048 -C admin@fabmedical
   ```

3. When asked to save the generated key to a file, enter `.ssh/fabmedical` for the name.

4. Enter a passphrase when prompted, and **don't forget it!** (Suggested passphrase: **at@February2021**)

5. Because you entered `.ssh/fabmedical` the ssh-keygen generates the file in the `.ssh` folder in your user folder, where the cloud shell opens by default.

   ![In this screenshot of the cloud shell window, ssh-keygen -t RSA -b 2048 -C admin@fabmedical has been typed and run at the command prompt. Information about the generated key appears in the window.](images/b4-image57.png "SSH Keygen")

6. From the cloud shell command line, enter the following command to output the public key content. Copy this information to use later.

    ```bash
    cat .ssh/fabmedical.pub
    ```

7. Keep this cloud shell open and remain in the default directory. You will use this shell in later tasks.

    ![In this screenshot of the cloud shell window, cat .ssh/fabmedical has been typed and run at the command prompt. Information about the public key content appears in the window.](images/b4-image571.png "Cloud Shell - cat .ssh")

### Task 5: Deploy ARM Template

In this section, you configure and execute an ARM template that creates all the resources that you need throughout the exercises.

1. In Azure cloud shell, switch to the ARM template directory:

   > **Note**: If you don't have a cloud shell available, refer back to [Task 1: Setup Azure Cloud Shell](#task-1-setup-azure-cloud-shell).

   ```bash
   cd AzureTrailblazerAcademy/month4/lab_aks/scripts
   ```

2. Open the azuredeploy.parameters.json file for editing using Azure Cloud Shell editor.

   ```bash
   code azuredeploy.parameters.json
   ```

   ![This screenshot shows the online editor for azure could shell. Display the azuredeploy.parameters.json](images/b4-image581.png "Edit azuredeploy.parameters.json")

3. Update the values for each of the fields below (including the public key you copied earlier):

   - **Suffix**: Enter a shortened version of your SUFFIX with a **max of 3 chars**.
   - **VirtualMachineAdminUsernameLinux**: The Linux Build Agent VM admin username (example: `"adminfabmedical"`).
   - **VirtualMachineAdminPublicKeyLinux**: The Linux Build Agent VM admin ssh public key. You find this value in the `.ssh/fabmedical.pub` file created previously (example: `"ssh-rsa AAAAB3N(...)vPiybQV admin@fabmedical"`).
   - **CosmosLocation**: The primary location of the Azure Cosmos DB. Use the same location as the resource group previously created (example: `"eastus"`).
   - **CosmosLocationName**: The name of the primary location of the Azure Cosmos DB. Use the name of the same location as the resource group previously created (example: `"East US"`).
   - **CosmosPairedLocation**: The secondary location of the Azure Cosmos DB. The below link can be used to help find the Azure Region Pair for your primary location. (example: `"westus"`).
   - **CosmosPairedLocationName**: The name of the secondary location of the Azure Cosmos DB. Use the location name that matches the secondary location defined in the previous key (example: `"West US"`).

   > **Note**: A list of Azure Region Pairs can be found here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions#azure-regional-pairs>.

4. Select the **...** button and select **Save**.

   ![In this screenshot of an Azure Cloud Shell editor window, the ... button has been selected, and the Save option is highlighted.](images/b4-image62.png "Azure Cloud Shell Save")

5. Select the **...** button again and select **Close Editor**.

   ![In this screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell editor window, the ... button has been selected, and the Close Editor option is highlighted.](images/b4-image63.png "Azure Cloud Shell Close")

6. Create the needed resources by typing the following instruction (case sensitive), replacing {resourceGroup} with the name of the previously created resource group:

   ```bash
   az deployment group create --resource-group {resourceGroup} --template-file azuredeploy.json --parameters azuredeploy.parameters.json
   ```

   This command takes 30 to 60 minutes to deploy all lab resources. You can continue to the next task to setup GitHub while the deployment runs.

   > **Note** If you get an error about the Cosmos DB name, ensure that you typed the `ComsosLocation` and `CosmosPairedLocation` without any spaces. Re-run the above command after you have corrected the name.

### Task 6: Create a GitHub repository

FabMedical has provided starter files for you. They have taken a copy of the websites for their customer Contoso Neuro and refactored it from a single node.js site into a website with a content API that serves up the speakers and sessions. This refactored code is a starting point to validate the containerization of their websites. Use this to help them complete a POC that validates the development workflow for running the website and API as Docker containers and managing them within the Azure Kubernetes Service environment.

1. Open a web browser and navigate to <https://www.github.com>. Log in using your GitHub account credentials.

2. In the upper-right corner, expand the user drop down menu and select **Your repositories**.

    ![The user menu is expanded with the Your repositories item selected.](images/2020-08-23-18-03-40.png "User menu, your repositories")

3. Next to the search criteria, locate and select the **New** button.

    ![The GitHub Find a repository search criteria is shown with the New button selected.](images/2020-08-23-18-08-02.png "New repository button")

4. On the **Create a new repository** screen, name the repository **Fabmedical**, configure it as **Public** and select the **Create repository** button.

    ![Create a new repository page with Repository name field and Create repository button highlighted.](images/2020-08-23-18-11-38.png "Create a new repository")

5. On the **Quick setup** screen, copy the **HTTPS** GitHub URL for your new repository, paste this in notepad for future use.

    ![Quick setup screen is displayed with the copy button next to the GitHub URL textbox selected.](images/2020-08-23-18-15-45.png "Quick setup screen")

6. Open a **new** Azure Cloud Shell console.  You can do this by selecting the **Open new session** button from the first console, or navigating to <https://shell.azure.com> and logging in with the same lab credentials.

7. Navigate to the FabMedical source code folder and list the contents.

   ```bash
   cd ~/AzureTrailblazerAcademy/month4/lab_aks/lab-files/infrastructure/
   ls
   ```

8. You'll see the listing includes three folders, one for the web site, another for the content API and one to initialize API data:

   ```bash
   content-api/
   content-init/
   content-web/
   ```

9. Set your username and email, which git uses for commits.

    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    ```

10. Using the Cloud Shell, initialize a new git repository:

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial Commit"
    ```

11. Set the remote origin to the GitHub URL by issuing the following command:

    ```bash
    git remote add origin <your GitHub URL>
    ```

12. Configure git CLI to cache your credentials, so that you don't have to keep re-typing them.

    ```bash
    git config --global --unset credential.helper
    git config --global credential.helper store
    ```

13. Push to the master branch by issuing the following command:

    ```bash
    git push -u origin master
    ```

    > **Note**: If you have multi-factor authentication, you will need to create a personal access token when using the cloud shell. Reference the following link for help with setting up a GitHub personal access token to use for authenticating `git` with your GitHub account: <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token>.

    > When creating the Personal Access Token, make sure you select the checkboxes for the categories **Repo** and **Workflow**.

    > **Note**: Once you have your personal access token, retry the above command, use your token as the password.

14. Refresh your GitHub repository, you should now see the code published.

### Task 7: Connect securely to the build agent

In this section, you validate that you can connect to the new build agent
VM.

1. Open a **new** Azure Cloud Shell console (or go to your root ~ folder in your existing Cloud Shell session) and run the following command to find the IP address for the build agent VM provisioned when you ran the ARM deployment:

   > **Note**: If you don't have a cloud shell available, refer back to [Task 1: Setup Azure Cloud Shell](#task-1-setup-azure-cloud-shell).

   ```bash
   az vm show -d -g fabmedical-[SUFFIX] -n fabmedical-[SHORT_SUFFIX] --query publicIps -o tsv
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   az vm show -d -g fabmedical-sol -n fabmedical-SOL --query publicIps -o tsv
   ```

2. In the cloud shell output, take note of the public IP address for the VM.

   ![The cloud shell window is displayed with the Public IP address shown.](images/b4-2019-10-01_11-58-05.png "Azure Cloud Shell Public IP")

3. Connect to the new VM you created by typing the following command:

   ```bash
    ssh -i [PRIVATEKEYNAME] [BUILDAGENTUSERNAME]@[BUILDAGENTIP]
   ```

   Replace the bracketed values in the command as follows:

   - `[PRIVATEKEYNAME]`: Use the private key name `.ssh/fabmedical`, created above.

   - `[BUILDAGENTUSERNAME]`: Use the username for the VM, in the default setup it is `adminfabmedical`.

   - `[BUILDAGENTIP]`: The IP address for the build agent VM, retrieved in the previous step.

   ```bash
   ssh -i .ssh/fabmedical adminfabmedical@52.174.141.11
   ```

4. When asked to confirm if you want to connect, as the authenticity of the connection cannot be validated, type `yes`.

5. When asked for the passphrase for the private key you created previously, enter this value.

6. SSH connects to the VM and displays a command prompt such as the following. Keep this cloud shell window open for the next step:

   `adminfabmedical@fabmedical-SUFFIX:~$`

   ![In this screenshot of a Cloud Shell window, ssh -i .ssh/fabmedical adminfabmedical@52.174.141.11 has been typed and run at the command prompt. The information detailed above appears in the window.](images/b4-image27.png "Azure Cloud Shell Connect to Host")

> **Note**: If you have issues connecting, you may have pasted the SSH public key incorrectly in the ARM template. Unfortunately, if this is the case, you will have to recreate the VM and try again.

### Task 8: Complete the build agent setup

In this task, you update the packages and install the Docker engine.

1. Go to the cloud shell window that has the SSH connection open to the build agent VM.

2. Update the Ubuntu packages and install curl and support for repositories over HTTPS in a single step by typing the following in a single line command. Respond by typing `Y` and pressing enter, if asked if you would like to proceed.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
   ```

   > **Note**: This is a single line.

3. Add Docker's official GPG key by typing the following in a single line command:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

4. Add Docker's stable repository to Ubuntu packages list by typing the following in a single line command:

   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
   ```

5. Add NodeJs PPA to use NodeJS LTS release and update the Ubuntu packages and install Docker engine, node.js, and the node package manager by typing the following commands, each on their own line. If asked if you would like to proceed, respond by typing `Y` and pressing enter.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install curl python-software-properties -y

   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -

   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce nodejs mongodb-clients
   ```

6. Now, upgrade the Ubuntu packages to the latest version by typing the following in a single line command.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get upgrade -y
   ```

7. When the command has completed, check the Docker version installed by executing this command. The output may look something like that shown in the following screenshot. Note that the server version is not shown yet, because you didn't run the command with elevated privileges (to be addressed shortly).

   ```bash
   docker version
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of a Cloud Shell window, docker version has been typed and run at the command prompt. Docker version information appears in the window.](images/docker-version.png "Display Docker version")

8. You may check the versions of node.js and npm as well, just for information purposes, using these commands:

   ```bash
   nodejs --version

   npm -version
   ```

9. Install the Angular CLI.

    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

10. To remove the requirement to use sudo, add your user to the Docker group. You can ignore any errors you see in the output.

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of a Cloud Shell window, sudo usermod -aG docker $USER has been typed and run at the command prompt. Errors appear in the window.](images/b4-image29.png "Remove SUDO requirement")

11. For the user permission changes to take effect, exit the SSH
    session by typing `exit`, then press \<Enter\>. Reconnect to the build agent VM using SSH as you did in the previous task.

    ```bash
    ssh -i .ssh/fabmedical adminfabmedical@52.174.141.11
    ```

12. Repeat the `docker version` command, and note the output now shows the server version as well.

    ![In this screenshot of a Cloud Shell window, docker version has been typed and run at the command prompt. Docker version information appears in the window, in addition to server version information.](images/docker-version-server.png "Display Docker version")

13. Run a few Docker commands:

    - One to see if there are any containers presently running.

      ```bash
      docker container ls
      ```

    - One to see if any containers exist, whether running or not.

      ```bash
      docker container ls -a
      ```

14. In both cases, you have an empty list but no errors while running the command. Your build agent is ready with the Docker engine running correctly.

    ![In this screenshot of a Cloud Shell window, docker container ls has been typed and run at the command prompt, as has the docker container ls -a command.](images/b4-image31.png "Display Docker container list")

### Task 9: Clone Repositories to the Build Agent

In this task, you clone your repositories from GitHub so you can work with them on the build agent.

1. As you previously did in cloud shell, set your username and email which are used for git commits.

   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```

   > **Note**: In some cases, the `root` user owns your user's `.config` folder. If this happens, run the following command to return ownership to `adminfabmedical` and then try the `git` command again:
   >
   > ```bash
   > sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/adminfabmedical/.config
   > ```

2. Configure git CLI to cache your credentials, so that you don't have to keep
   re-typing them.

   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper cache
   ```

   > **Note**: In some cases, the `root` user owns your user's `.config` folder. If this happens, run the following command to return ownership to `adminfabmedical` and then try the `git` command again:
   >
   > ```bash
   > sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/adminfabmedical/.config
   > ```

3. Use the GitHub URL to clone the repository code to your build agent machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```

   > **Note**: In some cases, the `root` user owns your user's `.config` folder. If this happens, run the following command to return ownership to `adminfabmedical` and then try the `git` command again:
   >
   > ```bash
   > sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/adminfabmedical/.config
   > ```

You should follow all steps provided _before_ continuing to the next section of the lab.


## Exercise 1: Create and run a Docker application

**Duration**: 40 minutes

In this exercise, you will take the starter files and run the node.js application as a Docker application. You will create a Dockerfile, build Docker images, and run containers to execute the application.

### Task 1: Test the application

The purpose of this task is to make sure you can run the application successfully before applying changes to run it as a Docker application.

1. From Azure Cloud Shell, connect to your build agent if you are not already connected. (If you need to reconnect, please review the instructions in the "Before the HOL" document.)

2. Type the following command to create a Docker network named `fabmedical`:

   ```bash
   docker network create fabmedical
   ```

3. Run an instance of mongodb to use for local testing.

   ```bash
   docker container run --name mongo --net fabmedical -p 27017:27017 -d mongo:4.0
   ```

   > **Note**:  With the existing source code written for MongoDB, it can be pointed towards the Azure Cosmos DB MongoDB API endpoint. The Azure Cosmos DB Emulator could be used for local development on Windows; however, the Cosmos DB emulator does not support Linux. As a result, when using Linux for development, MongoDB is still needed for local development environments; with Azure Cosmos DB used for data storage in the cloud. This allows existing source code written for MongoDB storage to be easily migrated to using Azure Cosmos DB backend.

4. Confirm that the mongo container is running and ready.

   ```bash
   docker container list
   docker container logs mongo
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console window, docker container list has been typed and run at the command prompt, and the âapiâ container is in the list. Below this the log output is shown.](images/Ex1-Task1.4.png "Docker container mongo logs")

5. Connect to the mongo instance using the mongo shell and test some basic commands:

   ```bash
   mongo
   ```

   ```text
   show dbs
   quit()
   ```

   ![This screenshot of the console window shows the output from connecting to mongo.](images/Ex1-Task1.5.png "Connect to mongodb")

6. To initialize the local database with test content, first navigate to the content-init directory and run npm install.

   ```bash
   cd ~/Fabmedical/content-init
   npm install
   ```

   > **Note**: In some cases, the `root` user will be assigned ownership of your user's `.config` folder. If this happens, run the following command to return ownership to `adminfabmedical` and then try `npm install` again:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/adminfabmedical/.config
   ```

7. Initialize the database.

   ```bash
   nodejs server.js
   ```

   ![This screenshot of the console window shows output from running the database initialization.](images/Ex1-Task1.7.png "Run nodejs server.js")

8. Confirm that the database now contains test data.

   ```bash
   mongo
   ```

   ```text
   show dbs
   use contentdb
   show collections
   db.speakers.find()
   db.sessions.find()
   quit()
   ```

   This should produce output similar to the following:

   ![This screenshot of the console window shows the data output.](images/Ex1-Task1.8.png "Show database records")

9. Now navigate to the `content-api` directory and run npm install.

   ```bash
   cd ../content-api
   npm install
   ```

   > **Note**: In some cases, the `root` user will be assigned ownership of your user's `.config` folder. If this happens, run the following command to return ownership to `adminfabmedical` and then try `npm install` again:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/adminfabmedical/.config
   ```

10. Start the API as a background process.

    ```bash
    nodejs ./server.js &
    ```

    ![In this screenshot, nodejs ./server.js & has been typed and run at the command prompt, which starts the API as a background process.](images/image47.png "Start the mongodb in background")

11. Press `ENTER` again to get to a command prompt for the next step.

12. Test the API using curl. You will request the speaker's content, and this will return a JSON result.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3001/speakers
    ```

    ![In this screenshot, made a curl request to view speakers.](images/image47_1.png "Display speaker data")

13. Navigate to the web application directory, run `npm install` and `ng build`.

    ```bash
    cd ../content-web
    npm install
    ng build
    ```

    ![In this screenshot, after navigating to the web application directory, nodejs ./server.js & has been typed and run at the command prompt, which runs the application as a background process as well.](images/image48.png "Running web server")

    > **Note**: In some cases, the `root` user will be assigned ownership of your user's `.config` folder. If this happens, run the following command to return ownership to `adminfabmedical` and then try `npm install` again:

     ```bash
     sudo chown -R $USER:$(id -gn $USER) /home/adminfabmedical/.config
     ```

14. In the Azure Portal, go to the VM that was recently created and copy its **Public IP Address**.

   ![In the Virtual Machine blade, Overview is selected on the left and Public IP address 52.174.141.11 is highlighted on the right.](images/image26.png "VM Public IP Address")

Another way of getting the Public IP of the VM is by running the following command from Azure Cloud Shell (while you are not connected to the VM):

    ```bash
    az vm show -d -g fabmedical-[SUFFIX] -n fabmedical-[SHORT_SUFFIX] --query publicIps -o tsv
    ```

    Example:

    ```bash
    az vm show -d -g fabmedical-sol -n fabmedical-SOL --query publicIps -o tsv
    ```

15. From the cloud shell in the build machine edit the `app.js` file using vim.

    ```bash
    vim app.js
    ```

    Then press **_i_** to get into the edit mode, after that replace localhost with the build machine IP address.

    ![Edit the app.js file in vim in the build machine to update the API URL.](images/image27.png "Edit the app.js")

    Then press **_ESC_**, write **_:wq_** to save you changes and close the file.

16. Now run the content-web application in the background.

    ```bash
    node ./app.js &
    ```

    Press `ENTER` again to get a command prompt for the next step.

17. Test the web application using curl. You will see HTML output returned without errors.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000
    ```

18. Leave the application running for the next task.

19. If you received a JSON response to the /speakers content request and an HTML response from the web application, your environment is working as expected.

### Task 2: Browsing to the web application

In this task, you will browse to the web application for testing.

1. Test the web application from a browser. Navigate to the web application using the VM's IP address at port `3000`.

   ```text
   http://[BUILDAGENTIP]:3000

   EXAMPLE: http://13.68.113.176:3000
   ```

5. Select the Speakers and Sessions links in the header. You will see the pages display the HTML version of the JSON content you curled previously.

6. Once you have verified the application is accessible through a browser, go to your cloud shell window and stop the running node processes.

   ```bash
   killall nodejs
   killall node
   ```

### Task 3: Create Docker images

In this task, you will create Docker images for the application --- one for the API application and another for the web application. Each image will be created via Docker commands that rely on a Dockerfile.

1. From cloud shell connected to the build agent VM, type the following command
   to view any Docker images on the VM. The list will only contain the mongodb
   image downloaded earlier.

   ```bash
   docker image ls
   ```

2. From the `content-api` folder containing the API application files, you will find a `Dockerfile` that was created for you. Type the following command to create a Docker image for the API application. This command does the following:

   - Executes the Docker build command to produce the image

   - Tags the resulting image with the name content-api (-t)

   - The final dot (`.`) indicates to use the Dockerfile in this current directory context. By default, this file is expected to have the name `Dockerfile` (case sensitive).

   ```bash
   docker image build -t content-api .
   ```

3. Once the image is successfully built, run the Docker images listing command again. You will see several new images: the node images and your container image.

   ```bash
   docker image ls
   ```

   Notice the untagged image. This is the build stage which contains all the intermediate files not needed in your final image.

   ![The node image (node) and your container image (content-api) are visible in this screenshot of the console window.](images/image59.png "List Docker images")

4. Navigate to the `content-web` folder again and list the files. Note that this folder has a Dockerfile.

   ```bash
   cd ../content-web
   ll
   ```

5. View the Dockerfile contents -- which are similar to the file you created previously in the API folder. Type the following command:

   ```bash
   cat Dockerfile
   ```

   > Notice that the `content-web` Dockerfile build stage includes additional tools for a front-end Angular application in addition to installing npm packages.

6. Type the following command to create a Docker image for the web application.

   ```bash
   docker image build -t content-web .
   ```

7. Navigate to the content-init folder again and list the files. Note that this folder already has a Dockerfile.

   ```bash
   cd ../content-init
   ll
   ```

8. View the Dockerfile contents -- which are similar to the file you created previously in the API folder. Type the following command:

   ```bash
   cat Dockerfile
   ```

9. Type the following command to create a Docker image for the init application.

      ```bash
      docker image build -t content-init .
      ```

10. When complete, you will see eight images now exist when you run the Docker images command.

   ```bash
   docker image ls
   ```

   ![Three images are now visible in this screenshot of the console window: content-init, content-web, content-api, and node.](images/vm-list-containers.PNG "View content images")

### Task 4: Run a containerized application

The web application container will be calling endpoints exposed by the API application container and the API application container will be communicating with mongodb. In this exercise, you will launch the images you created as containers on the same bridge network you created when starting mongodb.

1. Create and start the API application container with the following command. The command does the following:

   - Names the container `api` for later reference with Docker commands.

   - Instructs the Docker engine to use the `fabmedical` network.

   - Instructs the Docker engine to use port `3001` and map that to the internal container port `3001`.

   - Creates a container from the specified image, by its tag, such as `content-api`.

   ```bash
   docker container run --name api --net fabmedical -p 3001:3001 content-api
   ```

2. The `docker container run` command has failed because it is configured to connect to mongodb using a localhost URL. However, now that content-api is isolated in a separate container, it cannot access mongodb via localhost even when running on the same docker host. Instead, the API must use the bridge network to connect to mongodb.

   ```text
      > content-api@0.0.0 start
   > node ./server.js

   Listening on port 3001
   Could not connect to MongoDB!
   MongooseServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017
   npm notice
   npm notice New patch version of npm available! 7.0.8 -> 7.0.13
   npm notice Changelog: <https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v7.0.13>
   npm notice Run `npm install -g npm@7.0.13` to update!
   npm notice
   npm ERR! code 255
   npm ERR! path /usr/src/app

   npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
   npm ERR!     /root/.npm/_logs/2020-11-23T03_04_12_948Z-debug.log
   ```

3. The content-api application allows an environment variable to configure the mongodb connection string. Remove the existing container, and then instruct the docker engine to set the environment variable by adding the `-e` switch to the `docker container run` command. Also, use the `-d` switch to run the api as a daemon.

   ```bash
   docker container rm api
   docker container run --name api --net fabmedical -p 3001:3001 -e MONGODB_CONNECTION=mongodb://mongo:27017/contentdb -d content-api
   ```

4. Enter the command to show running containers. You will observe that the `api` container is in the list. Use the docker logs command to see that the API application has connected to mongodb.

   ```bash
   docker container ls
   docker container logs api
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console window, docker container ls has been typed and run at the command prompt, and the "api" container is in the list with the following values for Container ID, Image, Command, Created, Status, Ports, and Names: 458d47f2aaf1, content-api, "docker-entrypoint.s...", 37 seconds ago, Up 36 seconds, 0.0.0.0:3001->3001/tcp, and api.](images/image61.png "List Docker containers")

5. Test the API by curling the URL. You will see JSON output as you did when testing previously.

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/speakers
   ```

6. Create and start the web application container with a similar `docker container run` command -- instruct the docker engine to use any port with the `-P` command.

   ```bash
   docker container run --name web --net fabmedical -P -d content-web
   ```

7. Enter the command to show running containers again, and you will observe that both the API and web containers are in the list. The web container shows a dynamically assigned port mapping to its internal container port `3000`.

   ```bash
   docker container ls
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console window, docker container ls has again been typed and run at the command prompt. 0.0.0.0:32768->3000/tcp is highlighted under Ports.](images/image62.png "List Docker containers")

8. Test the web application by fetching the URL with curl. For the port, use the dynamically assigned port, which you can find in the output from the previous command. You will see HTML output, as you did when testing previously.

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:[PORT]/speakers.html
   ```

### Task 5: Setup environment variables

In this task, you will configure the `web` container to communicate with the API container using an environment variable, similar to the way the mongodb connection string is provided to the api.

1. From cloud shell connected to the build agent VM, stop and remove the web container using the following commands.

   ```bash
   docker container stop web
   docker container rm web
   ```

2. Validate that the web container is no longer running or present by using the `-a` flag as shown in this command. You will see that the `web` container is no longer listed.

   ```bash
   docker container ls -a
   ```

3. Review the `app.js` file.

   ```bash
   cd ../content-web
   cat app.js
   ```

4. Observe that the `contentApiUrl` variable can be set with an environment variable.

   ```javascript
   const contentApiUrl = process.env.CONTENT_API_URL || "http://[VM IP]:3001";
   ```

5. Open the Dockerfile for editing using Vim and press the `i` key to go into edit mode.

   ```bash
   vi Dockerfile
   <i>
   ```

6. Locate the `EXPOSE` line shown below and add a line above it that sets the default value for the environment variable, as shown in the screenshot.

   ```Dockerfile
   ENV CONTENT_API_URL http://localhost:3001
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of Dockerfile, the CONTENT_API_URL code appears above the next Dockerfile line, which reads EXPOSE 3000.](images/hol-2019-10-01_19-37-35.png "Set ENV variable")

7. Press the Escape key and type `:wq` and then press the Enter key to save and close the file.

   ```text
   <Esc>
   :wq
   <Enter>
   ```

8. Rebuild the web application Docker image using the same command as you did previously.

   ```bash
   docker image build -t content-web .
   ```

9. Create and start the image passing the correct URI to the API container as an environment variable. This variable will address the API application using its container name over the Docker network you created. After running the container, check to see the container is running and note the dynamic port assignment for the next step.

   ```bash
   docker container run --name web --net fabmedical -P -d -e CONTENT_API_URL=http://api:3001 content-web
   docker container ls
   ```

10. Curl the speakers path again, using the port assigned to the web container. Again, you will see HTML returned, but because curl does not process javascript, you cannot determine if the web application is communicating with the api application. You must verify this connection in a browser.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:[PORT]/speakers.html
    ```

11. You will not be able to browse to the web application on the ephemeral port because the VM only exposes a limited port range. Now you will stop the web container and restart it using port 3000 to test in the browser. Type the following commands to stop the container, remove it, and run it again using explicit settings for the port.

    ```bash
     docker container stop web
     docker container rm web
     docker container run --name web --net fabmedical -p 3000:3000 -d -e CONTENT_API_URL=http://api:3001 content-web
    ```

    > **WARNING:** If you receive an error such as `Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:3000:  bind: address already in use.` the previous Node instance might be holding the port 3000. Run `sudo pkill  node` to kill the local node instance.

12. Curl the speaker path again, using port `3000`. You will see the same HTML returned.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000/speakers.html
    ```

13. You can now use a web browser to navigate to the website and successfully view the application at port `3000`. Replace `[BUILDAGENTIP]` with the IP address you used previously.

    ```bash
    http://[BUILDAGENTIP]:3000

    EXAMPLE: http://13.68.113.176:3000
    ```

14. Commit your changes and push to the repository.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Setup Environment Variables"
    git push
    ```

    Enter credentials if prompted.

### Task 6: Push images to Azure Container Registry

To run containers in a remote environment, you will typically push images to a Docker registry, where you can store and distribute images. Each service will have a repository that can be pushed to and pulled from with Docker commands. Azure Container Registry (ACR) is a managed private Docker registry service based on Docker Registry v2.

In this task, you will push images to your ACR account, version images with tagging, and setup continuous integration (CI) to build future versions of your containers and push them to ACR automatically.

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to the ACR you created in Before the hands-on lab.

2. Select **Access keys** under **Settings** on the left-hand menu.

   ![In this screenshot of the left-hand menu, Access keys is highlighted below Settings.](images/image64.png "Access keys")

3. The Access keys blade displays the Login server, username, and password that will be required for the next step. Keep this handy as you perform actions on the build VM.

   > **Note**: If the username and password do not appear, select Enable on the Admin user option.

4. From the cloud shell session connected to your build VM, login to your ACR account by typing the following command. Follow the instructions to complete the login.

   ```bash
   docker login [LOGINSERVER] -u [USERNAME] -p [PASSWORD]
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   docker login fabmedicalsoll.azurecr.io -u fabmedicalsoll -p +W/j=l+Fcze=n07SchxvGSlvsLRh/7ga
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console window, the following has been typed and run at the command prompt: docker login fabmedicalsoll.azurecr.io](images/image65.png "Docker log into container")

   > **Tip**: Make sure to specify the fully qualified registry login server (all lowercase).

5. Run the following commands to properly tag your images to match your ACR account name.

   ```bash
   docker image tag content-web [LOGINSERVER]/content-web
   docker image tag content-api [LOGINSERVER]/content-api
   docker image tag content-init [LOGINSERVER]/content-init
   ```

   > **Note**: Be sure to replace the `[LOGINSERVER]` of your ACR instance.

6. List your docker images and look at the repository and tag. Note that the repository is prefixed with your ACR login server name, such as the sample shown in the screenshot below.

   ```bash
   docker image ls
   ```

   ![This is a screenshot of a docker images list example.](images/vm-docker-images-list.PNG "Docker image list")

7. Push the images to your ACR account with the following command:

   ```bash
   docker image push [LOGINSERVER]/content-web
   docker image push [LOGINSERVER]/content-api
   docker image push [LOGINSERVER]/content-init
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console window, an example of images being pushed to an ACR account results from typing and running the following at the command prompt: docker push [LOGINSERVER]/content-web.](images/image67.png "Push image to ACR")

8. In the Azure Portal, navigate to your ACR account, and select **Repositories (1)** under **Services** on the left-hand menu. You will now see three containers, one for each image.

9. Select `content-api` **(1)**. You will see the latest tag **(2)** is assigned.

   ![In this screenshot, content-api is selected under Repositories, and the Tags blade appears on the right.](images/acr-content-api-latest.png "View latest repo tags")

10. From the cloud shell session attached to the VM, assign the `v1` tag to each image with the following commands. Then list the Docker images to note that there are now two entries for each image: showing the `latest` tag and the `v1` tag. Also note that the image ID is the same for the two entries, as there is only one copy of the image.

    ```bash
    docker image tag [LOGINSERVER]/content-web:latest [LOGINSERVER]/content-web:v1
    docker image tag [LOGINSERVER]/content-api:latest [LOGINSERVER]/content-api:v1
    docker image tag [LOGINSERVER]/content-init:latest [LOGINSERVER]/content-init:v1
    docker image ls
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of the console window is an example of tags being added and displayed.](images/image70.png "View latest image by tag")

11. Push the images to your ACR account with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker image push [LOGINSERVER]/content-web:v1
    docker image push [LOGINSERVER]/content-api:v1
    docker image push [LOGINSERVER]/content-init:v1
    ```

12. Refresh one of the repositories to see the two versions of the image now appear.

    ![In this screenshot, content-api is selected under Repositories, and the Tags blade appears on the right. In the Tags blade, latest and v1 appear under Tags.](images/image71.png "View two versions of image")

13. Run the following commands to pull an image from the repository. Note that the default behavior is to pull images tagged with `latest`. You can pull a specific version using the version tag. Also, note that since the images already exist on the build agent, nothing is downloaded.

    ```bash
    docker image pull [LOGINSERVER]/content-web
    docker image pull [LOGINSERVER]/content-web:v1
    ```

### Task 7: Setup CI Pipeline to Push Images

In this task, you will use YAML to define a GitHub Actions workflow that builds your Docker
image and pushes it to your ACR instance automatically.

1. In GitHub, return to the **Fabmedical** repository screen, and select the **Settings** tab.

2. From the left menu, select **Secrets**.

3. Select the **New repository secret** button.

    ![Settings link, Secrets link, and New secret button are highlighted.](images/2020-08-24-21-45-42.png "GitHub Repository secrets")

4. In the **New secret** form, enter the name `ACR_USERNAME` and for the value, paste in the Azure Container Registry **Username** that was copied previously. Select **Add secret**.

    ![New secret screen with values are entered.](images/2020-08-24-21-48-54.png "New secret screen")

5. Add another Secret, by entering the name `ACR_PASSWORD` and for the value, paste in the Azure Container Registry **Password** that was copied previously.

    ![Secrets screen with both the ACR_USERNAME and ACR_PASSWORD secrets created.](images/2020-08-24-21-51-24.png "Secrets screen")

6. In your Azure Cloud Shell session connected to the build agent VM, navigate to the `~/Fabmedical/.github/workflows` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Fabmedical/.github/workflows
   ```
7. Next create the workflow YAML file.

    ```dotnetcli
    vi content-web.yml
    ```

   Type 'i' to enter in 'Insert mode' and add the following as the content. Be sure to replace the following placeholders:

   - replace `[SHORT_SUFFIX]` with your short suffix such as `SOL`.

    ```yml
    name: content-web

    # This workflow is triggered on push to the 'content-web' directory of the  master branch of the repository
    on:
      push:
        branches:
        - master
        paths:
        - 'content-web/**'

      # Configure workflow to also support triggering manually
      workflow_dispatch:

    # Environment variables are defined so that they can be used throughout the job definitions.
    env:
      imageRepository: 'content-web'
      resourceGroupName: 'fabmedical-[SHORT_SUFFIX]'
      containerRegistryName: 'fabmedical[SHORT_SUFFIX]'
      containerRegistry: 'fabmedical[SHORT_SUFFIX].azurecr.io'
      dockerfilePath: './content-web'
      tag: '${{ github.run_id  }}'

    # Jobs define the actions that take place when code is pushed to the master branch
    jobs:
      build-and-publish-docker-image:
        name: Build and Push Docker Image
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        # Checkout the repo
        - uses: actions/checkout@master

        - name: Set up Docker Buildx
          uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

        - name: Login to ACR
          uses: docker/login-action@v1
          with:
            registry: ${{ env.containerRegistry }}
            username: ${{ secrets.ACR_USERNAME }}
            password: ${{ secrets.ACR_PASSWORD }}

        - name: Build and push an image to container registry
          uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
          with:
            context: ${{ env.dockerfilePath  }}
            file: "${{ env.dockerfilePath }}/Dockerfile"
            pull: true
            push: true
            tags: |
              ${{ env.containerRegistry }}/${{ env.imageRepository }}:${{ env.tag }}
              ${{ env.containerRegistry }}/${{ env.imageRepository }}:latest
    ```

8. Save the file and exit VI by pressing `<Esc>` then `:wq`.

9. Save the pipeline YAML, then commit and push it to the Git repository:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added workflow YAML"
    git push
    ```

10. In GitHub, return to the **Fabmedical** repository screen, and select the **Actions** tab.

11. On the **Actions** page, select the **content-web** workflow.

12. On the **content-web** workflow, select **Run workflow** and manually trigger the workflow to execute.

    ![The content-web Action is shown with the Actions, content-web, and Run workflow links highlighted.](images/2020-08-25-15-38-06.png "content-web workflow")

13. After a second, the newly triggered workflow execution will display in the list. Select the new **content-web** execution to view its status.

14. Selecting the **Build and Push Docker Image** job of the workflow will display its execution status.

    ![Build and Push Docker Image job.](images/2020-08-25-15-42-11.png "Build and Push Docker Image job")

15. Next, setup the `content-api` workflow. There is already a `content-api.yml` file located within the `.github/workflows` directory. Open the `.github/workflows/content-api.yml` file for editing.

16. Edit the `resourceGroupName` and `containerRegistry` environment values to replace `[SHORT_SUFFIX]` with your own three-letter suffix so that it matches your container registry's name and resource group.

    ![The screenshot shows the content-api.yml with the environment variables highlighted.](images/2020-08-25-15-59-56.png "content-api.yml environment variables highlighted")

17. Save the file

18. Next, setup the **content-init** workflow. Follow the same steps as the previous `content-api` workflow for the `content-init.yml` file, remembering to update the `[SHORT_SUFFIX]` value with your own three-letter suffix.

19. Commit and push these changes to the Git repository:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Updated workflow YAML"
    git push
    ```

20. Then, navigate to the repositories in GitHub, select Actions, and then manually run the **content-api** and **content-init** workflows.

## Exercise 2: Migrate MongoDB to Cosmos DB using Azure Database Migration Service

**Duration**: 20 minutes

At this point, you have the web and API applications running in Docker instance (VM - Build Agent). The next, step is to migrate the MongoDB database data over to Azure Cosmos DB. This exercise will use the Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the data from the MongoDB database into Azure Cosmos DB.

### Task 1: Enable Microsoft.DataMigration resource provider

In this task, you will enable the use of the Azure Database Migration Service within your Azure subscription by registering the `Microsoft.DataMigration` resource provider.

1. Open the Azure Cloud Shell.

2. Run the following Azure CLI command to register the `Microsoft.DataMigration` resource provider in your Azure subscription:

   ```sh
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DataMigration
   ```

### Task 2: Provision Azure Database Migration Service

In this task, you will deploy an instance of the Azure Database Migration Service that will be used to migrate the data from MongoDB to Cosmos DB.

1. From the Azure Portal, select **+ Create a resource**.

2. Search the marketplace for **Azure Database Migration Service** and select it.

3. Select **Create**.

    ![The screenshot shows the Azure Database Migration Service in the Azure Marketplace.](images/dms-marketplace-create.png "Azure Database Migration Service")

4. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create Migration Service** pane, enter the following values:

    - Resource group: Select the Resource Group created with this lab.
    - Migration service name: Enter a name, such as `fabmedical[SUFFIX]`.
    - Location: Choose the Azure Region used for the Resource Group.

    ![The screenshot shows the Create Migration Service Basics tab with all values entered.](images/dms-create-basics.png "Create Migration Basics Tab")

5. Select **Next: Networking >>**.

6. On the **Networking** tab, select the **Virtual Network** within the `fabmedical-[SUFFIX]` resource group.

    ![The screenshot shows the Create Migration Service Networking tab with Virtual Network selected.](images/dms-create-networking.png "Create Migration Service Networking tab")

7. Select **Review + create**.

8. Select **Create** to create the Azure Database Migration Service instance.

The service may take 5 - 10 minutes to provision.

### Task 3: Migrate data to Azure Cosmos DB

In this task, you will create a **Migration project** within Azure Database Migration Service, and then migrate the data from MongoDB to Azure Cosmos DB.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to your Build Agent VM, and copy the Private IP address **(2)**. Paste the contents into the text editor of your choice (such as Notepad on Windows, macOS users can use TextEdit) for future use.

   ![Built Agent VM is shown. Overview tab is open. Private IP address is highlighted.](images/agent-vm-private-ip-address.png "Private IP Address")

2. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the **Azure Database Migration Service** that was previously provisioned.

3. On the Azure Database Migration Service blade, select **+ New Migration Project** on the **Overview** pane.

4. On the **New migration project** pane, enter the following values, then select **Create and run activity**:

    - Project name: `fabmedical`
    - Source server type: `MongoDB`
    - Target server type: `CosmosDB (MongoDB API)`
    - Choose type of activity: `Offline data migration`

    ![The screenshot shows the New migration project pane with values entered.](images/dms-new-migration-project.png "New migration project pane")

    > **Note:** The **Offline data migration** activity type is selected since you will be performing a one-time migration from MongoDB to Cosmos DB. Also, the data in the database won't be updated during the migration. In a production scenario, you will want to choose the migration project activity type that best fits your solution requirements.

5. On the **MongoDB to Azure Database for CosmosDB Offline Migration Wizard** pane, enter the following values for the **Select source** tab:

    - Mode: **Standard mode**
    - Source server name: Enter the Private IP Address of the Build Agent VM used in this lab.
    - Server port: `27017`
    - Require SSL: Unchecked

    > **Note:** Leave the **User Name** and **Password** blank as the MongoDB instance on the Build Agent VM for this lab does not have authentication turned on. The Azure Database Migration Service is connected to the same VNet as the Build Agent VM, so it's able to communicate within the VNet directly to the VM without exposing the MongoDB service to the Internet. In production scenarios, you should always have authentication enabled on MongoDB.

    ![Select source tab with values selected for the MongoDB server.](images/dms-select-source.png "MongoDB to Azure Database for CosmosDB - Select source")

6. Select **Next: Select target >>**.

7. On the **Select target** pane, select the following values:

    - Mode: **Select Cosmos DB target**

    - Subscription: Select the Azure subscription you're using for this lab.

    - Select Cosmos DB name: Select the `fabmedical-[SUFFIX]` Cosmos DB instance.

    ![The Select target tab with values selected.](images/dms-select-target.png "MongoDB to Azure Database for CosmosDB - Select target")

    Notice, the **Connection String** will automatically populate with the Key for your Azure Cosmos DB instance.

8. Select **Next: Database setting >>**.

9. On the **Database setting** tab, select the `contentdb` **Source Database** so this database from MongoDB will be migrated to Azure Cosmos DB.

    ![The screenshot shows the Database setting tab with the contentdb source database selected.](images/dms-database-setting.png "Database setting tab")

10. Select **Next: Collection setting >>**.

11. On the **Collection setting** tab, expand the **contentdb** database, and ensure both the **sessions** and **speakers** collections are selected for migration. Also, update the **Throughput (RU/s)** to `400` for both collections.

    ![The screenshot shows the Collection setting tab with both sessions and speakers collections selected with Throughput RU/s set to 400 for both collections.](images/dms-collection-setting.png "Throughput RU")

12. Select **Next: Migration summary >>**.

13. On the **Migration summary** tab, enter `MigrateData` in the **Activity name** field, then select **Start migration** to initiate the migration of the MongoDB data to Azure Cosmos DB.

    ![The screenshot shows the Migration summary is shown with MigrateData entered in the Activity name field.](images/dms-migration-summary.png "Migration summary")

14. The status for the migration activity will be shown. The migration will only take a few seconds to complete. Select **Refresh** to reload the status to ensure it shows a **Status** of **Complete**.

     ![The screenshot shows the MigrateData activity showing the status has completed.](images/dms-migrate-complete.png "MigrateData activity completed")

15. To verify the data was migrated, navigate to the **Cosmos DB Account** for the lab within the Azure Portal, then select the **Data Explorer**. You will see the `speakers` and `sessions` collections listed within the `contentdb` database, and you will be able to explore the documents within.

    ![The screenshot shows the Cosmos DB is open in the Azure Portal with Data Explorer open showing the data has been migrated.](images/dms-confirm-data-in-cosmosdb.png "Cosmos DB is open")

## Exercise 3: Deploy the solution to Azure Kubernetes Service

**Duration**: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will connect to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster you created before the hands-on lab and deploy the Docker application to the cluster using Kubernetes.

### Task 1: Connect to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

In this task, you will gather the information you need about your Azure Kubernetes Service cluster to connect to the cluster and execute commands usign kubectl directly the from cloud shell.

> **Note**: The following tasks should be executed in cloud shell and not the build machine, so disconnect from build machine if still connected.

1. Verify that you are connected to the correct subscription with the following command to show your default subscription:

   ```bash
   az account show
   ```

   - If you are not connected to the correct subscription, list your subscriptions and then set the subscription by its id with the following commands (similar to what you did in cloud shell before the lab):

   ```bash
   az account list
   az account set --subscription {id}
   ```

2. Configure kubectl to connect to the Kubernetes cluster:

   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials -a --name fabmedical-SUFFIX --resource-group fabmedical-SUFFIX
   ```

3. Test that the configuration is correct by running a simple kubectl command to produce a list of nodes:

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console, kubectl get nodes has been typed and run at the command prompt, which produces a list of nodes.](images/image75.png "kubectl get nodes")

### Task 2: Deploy a service using the Azure Portal

In this task, you will deploy the API application to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster using the Azure Portal.

1. We first need to define a Service for our API so that the application is accessible within the cluster. In the AKS blade in the Azure Portal select **Services and ingresses** and on the Services tab select **+ Add**.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing adding a Service.](images/2021-03-25-17-04-04.png "Add a Service")

2. In the **Add with YAML** screen, paste following YAML and choose **Add**.

   ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: api
      name: api
    spec:
      ports:
        - name: api-traffic
          port: 3001
          protocol: TCP
          targetPort: 3001
      selector:
        app: api
      sessionAffinity: None
      type: ClusterIP
   ```

3. Now select **Workloads** under the **Kubernetes resources** section in the left navigation.

    ![Select workloads under Kubernetes resources.](images/2021-03-25-17-04-35.png "Select workloads under Kubernetes resources")

4. From the Workloads view, with **Deployments** selected (the default) then select **+ Add**.

   ![Selecting + Add to create a deployment.](images/2021-03-25-17-05-05.png "Selecing + Add to create a deployment")

5. In the **Add with YAML** screen that loads paste the following YAML and update the `[LOGINSERVER]` placeholder with the name of the ACR instance.

   ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: api
      name: api
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: api
      strategy:
        rollingUpdate:
        maxSurge: 1
        maxUnavailable: 1
        type: RollingUpdate
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: api
            name: api
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: api
              image: [LOGINSERVER].azurecr.io/content-api
              imagePullPolicy: Always
              livenessProbe:
                httpGet:
                  path: /
                  port: 3001
                initialDelaySeconds: 30
                periodSeconds: 20
                timeoutSeconds: 10
                failureThreshold: 3
              ports:
                - containerPort: 3001
                  hostPort: 3001
                  protocol: TCP
              resources:
                requests:
                  cpu: 1
                  memory: 128Mi
              securityContext:
                privileged: false
                terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
                terminationMessagePolicy: File
                dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
                restartPolicy: Always
                schedulerName: default-scheduler
                securityContext: {}
                terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
   ```

6. Select **Add** to initiate the deployment. This can take a few minutes after which you will see the deployment listed.

   ![Service is showing as unhealthy](images/2021-03-25-17-05-36.png "Service is showing as unhealthy")

7. Select the **api** deployment to open the Deployment, select **Live logs** and then a Pod from the drop-down. After a few moments the live logs should appear.

   ![Service is showing as unhealthy](images/2021-03-25-17-06-09.png "Service is showing as unhealthy")

   > **Note:** if the logs don't display it may be the Pod no longer exists. You can use the **View in Log Analytics** to view historical logs regardless of Pod.

8. If you scroll through the log you can see it indicates that the content-api application is once again failing because it cannot find a MongoDB api to communicate with. You will resolve this issue by connecting to Cosmos DB.

   ![This screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard shows logs output for the api container.](images/2021-03-25-17-07-13.png "MongoDB communication error")

9. In the Azure Portal navigate to your resource group and find your Cosmos DB. Select the Cosmos DB resource to view details.

   ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal showing the Cosmos DB among existing resources.](images/Ex2-Task1.9.png "Select CosmosDB resource from list")

10. Under **Quick Start** select the **Node.js** tab and copy the **Node.js 3.0 connection string**.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal showing the quick start for setting up Cosmos DB with MongoDB API. The copy button is highlighted.](images/Ex2-Task1.10.png "Capture CosmosDB connection string")

11. Modify the copied connection string by adding the database `contentdb` to the URL, along with a replicaSet of `globaldb`. The resulting connection string should look like the below sample. Note that you may need to modify the endpoint URL.

    > **Note**: Username and password redacted for brevity.

    ```text
    mongodb://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@fabmedical-<SUFFIX>.documents.azure.com:10255/contentdb?ssl=true&replicaSet=globaldb
    ```

12. You will setup a Kubernetes secret to store the connection string and configure the `content-api` application to access the secret. First, you must base64 encode the secret value. Open your Azure Cloud Shell window and use the following command to encode the connection string and then, copy the output.

    > **Note**: Double quote marks surrounding the connection string are required to successfully produce the required output.

    ```bash
    echo -n "[CONNECTION STRING VALUE]" | base64 -w 0 - | echo $(</dev/stdin)
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure cloud shell window showing the command to create the base64 encoded secret.  The output to copy is highlighted.](images/hol-2019-10-18_07-12-13.png "Show encoded secret")

13. Return to the AKS blade in the Azure Portal and select **Configuration** under the **Kubernetes resources** section. Select **Secrets** and choose **+ Add**.

14. In the **Add with YAML** screen, paste following YAML and replace the placeholder with the encoded connection string from your clipboard and choose **Add**. Note that YAML is position sensitive so you must ensure indentation is correct when typing or pasting.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: cosmosdb
    type: Opaque
    data:
      db: <base64 encoded value>
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS howing the YAML file for creating a deployment.](images/2021-03-25-17-08-06.png "Upload YAML data")

15. Sort the Secrets list by name and you should now see your new secret displayed.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing secrets.](images/find-cosmosdb-secret.png "Manage Kubernetes secrets")

16. View the details for the **cosmosdb** secret by selected it in the list.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing the value of a secret.](images/2021-03-25-17-08-54.png "View cosmosdb secret")

17. Next, download the api deployment configuration using the following command in your Azure Cloud Shell window:

    ```bash
    kubectl get -o=yaml deployment api > api.deployment.yml
    ```

18. Edit the downloaded file using cloud shell code editor:

    ```bash
    code api.deployment.yml
    ```

    Add the following environment configuration to the container spec, below the `image` property:

    ```yaml
      env:
      - name: MONGODB_CONNECTION
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: cosmosdb
            key: db
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing part of the deployment file.](images/Ex2-Task1.17.png "Edit the api.deployment.yml file")

19. Save your changes and close the editor.

    ![This is a screenshot of the code editor save and close actions.](images/Ex2-Task1.17.1.png "Code editor configuration update")

20. Update the api deployment by using `kubectl` to deploy the API.

    ```bash
    kubectl delete deployment api
    kubectl create -f api.deployment.yml
    ```

21. In the Azure Portal return to Live logs (see Step 5). The last log should show as connected to MongoDB.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing logs output.](images/2021-03-25-17-09-24.png "API Logs")

### Task 3: Deploy a service using kubectl

In this task, deploy the web service using `kubectl`.

1. Open a **new** Azure Cloud Shell console.

2. Create a text file called `web.deployment.yml` using the Azure Cloud Shell
   Editor.

   ```bash

         targetPort: 3000
     selector:
       app: web
     sessionAffinity: None
     type: LoadBalancer
   ```

9. Save changes and close the editor.

10. Type the following command to deploy the application described by the YAML files. You will receive a message indicating the items kubectl has created a web deployment and a web service.

    ```bash
    kubectl create --save-config=true -f web.deployment.yml -f web.service.yml
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of the console, kubectl apply -f kubernetes-web.yaml has been typed and run at the command prompt. Messages about web deployment and web service creation appear below.](images/image93.png "kubectl create application")

11. Return to the AKS blade in the Azure Portal. From the navigation menu, under **Kubernetes resources**, select the **Services and ingresses** view. You should be able to access the website via an external endpoint (It might take a couple of minutes for the service for the site work as it is being deployed).

    ![AKS services and ingresses shown with External IP highlighted](images/aks-resources-services-ingresses-view.png "AKS services and ingresses shown with External IP highlighted")

12. In the top navigation, select the `speakers` and `sessions` links.

    ![A screenshot of the web site showing no data displayed.](images/Ex2-Task3.11.png "Web site home page")

### Task 4: Deploy a service using a Helm chart

In this task, you will deploy the web service using a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart to streamline the installing and managing the container-based application on the Azure Kubernetes cluster.

You will configure a Helm Chart that will be used to deploy and configure the **content-web** container image to Kubernetes. This is a technique that can be used to more easily deploy and manage the application on the Azure Kubernetes Cluster.

1. From the AKS blade in the Azure Portal, under **Kubernetes resources**, select **Workloads**.

2. Select the `web` Deployment and then choose **Delete**. When prompted, check **Confirm delete** and select **Delete** again.

   ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing how to delete a deployment.](images/2021-03-26-16-42-03.png "Kubernetes dashboard web deployments")

3. From the AKS blade in the Azure Portal, under **Kubernetes resources**, select **Services and ingresses**.

4. Select the `web` Service and then choose **Delete**. When prompted, check **Confirm delete** and select **Delete** again.

   ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing how to delete a deployment.](images/2021-03-26-16-43-29.png "Kubernetes delete deployment")

5. Open a **new** Azure Cloud Shell.

6. Clone your fabmedical repository (replace URL with URL of your repository):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/USER_NAME/fabmedical.git
    ```

7. Execute the following command to go inside the `web` directory (replace 'fabmedical' with the directory created by your clone):

    ```bash
    cd ~/fabmedical/content-web/charts/web
    ```

8. We now need to update the generated scaffold to match our requirements. We will first update the file named `values.yaml`.

    ```bash
    code values.yaml
    ```

9. Search for the `image` definition and update the values so that they match the following:

    ```yaml
    image:
      repository: [LOGINSERVER].azurecr.io/content-web
      pullPolicy: Always
    ```

10. Search for `nameOverride` and `fullnameOverride` entries and update the values so that they match the following:

    ```yaml
    nameOverride: "web"
    fullnameOverride: "web"
    ```

11. Search for the `service` definition and update the values so that they match the following:

    ```yaml
    service:
      type: LoadBalancer
      port: 80
    ```

12. Search for the `resources` definition and update the values so that they match the following. You are removing the curly braces and adding the `requests` (make sure to remove the {} characters after the `resource:` node):

    ```yaml
    resources:
      # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
      # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
      # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
      # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
      # limits:
      #  cpu: 100m
      #  memory: 128Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 1000m
        memory: 128Mi
    ```

13. Save changes and close the editor.

14. We will now update the file named `Chart.yaml`.

    ```bash
    code Chart.yaml
    ```

15. Search for the `appVersion` entry and update the value so that it matches the following:

    ```yaml
    appVersion: latest
    ```

16. We will now update the file named `deployment.yaml`.

    ```bash
    cd templates
    code deployment.yaml
    ```

17. Search for the `metadata` definition and update the values so that they match the following. You are replacing the line under annotations:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      (...)
    spec:
      (...)
      template:
        metadata:
          (...)
          annotations:
            rollme: {{ randAlphaNum 5 | quote }}
    ```

18. Search for the `containers` definition and update the values so that they match the following. You are changing the `containerPort`, `livenessProbe` port and adding the `env` variable:

    ```yaml
    containers:
      - name: {{ .Chart.Name }}
        securityContext:
          {{- toYaml .Values.securityContext | nindent 12 }}
        image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}"
        imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }}
        ports:
          - name: http
            containerPort: 3000
            protocol: TCP
        env:
          - name: CONTENT_API_URL
            value: http://api:3001
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 3000
    ```

19. Save changes and close the editor.

20. We will now update the file named `service.yaml`.

    ```bash
    code service.yaml
    ```

21. Search for the `ports` definition and update the values so that they match the following:

    ```yaml
    ports:
      - port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
        targetPort: 3000
        protocol: TCP
        name: http
    ```

22. Save changes and close the editor.

23. The chart is now setup to deploy our web container. Type the following command to deploy the application described by the Helm chart. You will receive a message indicating that helm has created a web deployment and a web service.

    ```bash
    cd ../..
    helm install web ./web
    ```

    ![In this screenshot of the console, helm install web ./web has been typed and run at the command prompt. Messages about web deployment and web service creation appear below.](images/Ex2-Task4.24.png "Helm web deployment messages")

24. Return to the browser where you have the Azure Portal open. From the navigation menu, select **Services and ingresses**. You will see the web service deploying which deployment can take a few minutes. When it completes, you should be able to access the website via an external endpoint.

    ![In the AKS Services and ingresses blade in the Azure Portal showing the web service selected.](images/2021-03-26-16-44-18.png "Web service endpoint")

25. Select the speakers and sessions links and check that content is displayed for each.

    ![A screenshot of the web site showing no data displayed.](images/Ex2-Task3.11.png "Web site home page")

26. We will now commit our Helm chart to our GitHub repository. Execute the following commands in the root folder of your 'fabmedical' clone:

    ```bash
    git add content-web/charts/
    git commit -m "Helm chart added."
    git push
    ```

### Task 5: Configure Continuous Delivery to the Kubernetes Cluster

In this task, you will use GitHub Actions workflows to automate the process for deploying the web image to the AKS cluster. You will update the workflow and configure a job so that when new images are pushed to the ACR, the pipeline deploys the image to the AKS cluster.

1. Navigate to the `.github/workflows` folder of the git repository, and open the `content-web.yml` workflow using `vi`:

    ```bash
    cd ~/fabmedical/.github/workflows
    vi content-web.yml
    ```

2. You will add a second job to the bottom of the `content-web.yml` workflow. Paste the following at the end of the file:

    > **Note**: Be careful to check your indenting when pasting. The `build-and-push-helm-chart` node should be indented with 2 spaces and line up with the node for the `build-and-publish-docker-image` job.

    ```yaml
      build-and-push-helm-chart:
        name: Build and Push Helm Chart
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        needs: [build-and-publish-docker-image]
        steps:
        # Checkout the repo
        - uses: actions/checkout@master

        - name: Helm Install
          uses: azure/setup-helm@v1

        - name: Helm Repo Add
          run: |
            helm repo add ${{ env.containerRegistryName }} https://${{ env.containerRegistry }}/helm/v1/repo --username ${{ secrets.ACR_USERNAME }} --password ${{ secrets.ACR_PASSWORD }}
          env:
            HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI: 1

        - name: Helm Chart Save
          run: |
            cd ./content-web/charts/web

            helm chart save . content-web:v${{ env.tag }}
            helm chart save . ${{ env.containerRegistry }}/helm/content-web:v${{ env.tag }}

            # list out saved charts
            helm chart list
          env:
            HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI: 1

        - name: Helm Chart Push
          run: |
            helm registry login ${{ env.containerRegistry }} --username ${{ secrets.ACR_USERNAME }} --password ${{ secrets.ACR_PASSWORD }}
            helm chart push ${{ env.containerRegistry }}/helm/content-web:v${{ env.tag }}
          env:
            HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI: 1
    ```

3. Save the file.

4. In the Azure Cloud Shell, use the following command to output the `/.kube/config` file that contains the credentials for authenticating with Azure Kubernetes Service. These credentials were retrieved previously and will also be needed by GitHub Actions to deploy to AKS. Then copy the contents of the file.

    ```bash
    cat ~/.kube/config
    ```

5. In GitHub, return to the **Fabmedical** repository screen, select the **Settings** tab, select **Secrets** from the left menu, then select the **New secret** button.

6. Create a new GitHub Secret with the Name of `KUBECONFIG` and paste in the contents of the `~/.kube/config` file that was previously copied.

    ![The screenshot displays the KUBECONFIG secret](images/2020-08-25-22-34-04.png "Edit KUBECONFIG secret")

7. Now return to edit the `content-web.yml` workflow and paste the following at the end of the file.

    > **Note**: Be careful to check your indenting when pasting. The `aks-deployment` node should be indented with 2 spaces and line up with the node for the `build-and-push-helm-chart` job.

    ```yaml
      aks-deployment:
        name: AKS Deployment
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        needs: [build-and-publish-docker-image,build-and-push-helm-chart]
        steps:
        # Checkout the repo
        - uses: actions/checkout@master

        - name: Helm Install
          uses: azure/setup-helm@v1

        - name: kubeconfig
          run: echo "${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG }}" >> kubeconfig

        - name: Helm Repo Add
          run: |
            helm repo add ${{ env.containerRegistry }} https://${{ env.containerRegistry }}/helm/v1/repo --username ${{ secrets.ACR_USERNAME }} --password ${{ secrets.ACR_PASSWORD }}
            helm repo update
          env:
            HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI: 1

        - name: Helm Upgrade
          run: |
            helm registry login ${{ env.containerRegistry }} --username ${{ secrets.ACR_USERNAME }} --password ${{ secrets.ACR_PASSWORD }}
            helm chart pull ${{ env.containerRegistry }}/helm/content-web:v${{ env.tag }}
            helm chart export ${{ env.containerRegistry }}/helm/content-web:v${{ env.tag }} --destination ./upgrade
            helm upgrade web ./upgrade/web
          env:
            KUBECONFIG: './kubeconfig'
            HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI: 1
    ```

8. Save the file.

9. Commit your changes

   ```bash
   cd ..
   git pull
   git add --all
   git commit -m "Deployment update."
   git push
   ```

10. Switch back to GitHub.

11. On the **content-web** workflow, select **Run workflow** and manually trigger the workflow to execute.

    ![The content-web Action is shown with the Actions, content-web, and Run workflow links highlighted.](images/2020-08-25-15-38-06.png "content-web workflow")

12. Selecting the currently running workflow will display its status.

    ![The screenshot shows workflow is running and the current status.](images/2020-08-25-22-15-39.png "Workflow is running")

### Task 6: Review Azure Monitor for Containers

In this task, you will access and review the various logs and dashboards made available by Azure Monitor for Containers.

1. From the Azure Portal, select the resource group you created named `fabmedical-SUFFIX`, and then select your `Kubernetes Service` Azure resource.

   ![In this screenshot, the resource group was previously selected and the AKS cluster is selected.](images/Ex2-Task8.1.png "Select fabmedical resource group")

2. From the Monitoring blade, select **Insights**.

   ![In the Monitoring blade, Insights is highlighted.](images/Ex2-Task8.2.png "Select Insights link")

3. Review the various available dashboards and a deeper look at the various metrics and logs available on the Cluster, Nodes, Controllers, and deployed Containers.

   ![In this screenshot, the dashboards and blades are shown. Cluster metrics can be reviewed.](images/Ex2-Task8.3.png "Review the dashboard metrics")

4. To review the Containers dashboards and see more detailed information about each container, select the **Containers** tab.

   ![In this screenshot, the various containers information is shown.](images/monitor_1.png "View containers data")

5. Now filter by container name and search for the **web** containers, you will see all the containers created in the Kubernetes cluster with the pod names.

   ![In this screenshot, the containers are filtered by container named web.](images/monitor_3.png "Filter data by container and web")

6. By default, the CPU Usage metric will be selected displaying all cpu information for the selected container, to switch to another metric open the metric dropdown list and select a different metric.

   ![In this screenshot, the various metric options are shown.](images/monitor_2.png "Filter by CPU usage")

7. Upon selecting any pod, all the information related to the selected metric will be displayed on the right panel, and that would be the case when selecting any other metric, the details will be displayed on the right panel for the selected pod.

   ![In this screenshot, the pod cpu usage details are shown.](images/monitor_4.png "POD CPU details")

8. To display the logs for any container simply select it and view the right panel and you will find "View container logs" option which will list all logs for this specific container.

   ![In the View in Analytics dropdown, the View container logs item is selected.](images/monitor_5.png "View container logs menu option")

   ![The container logs are displayed based on a query entered in the query window.](images/monitor_6.png "Container logs")

9. For each log entry you can display more information by expanding the log entry to view the below details.

   ![The container log query results are displayed, one log entry is expanded in the results view with its details shown.](images/monitor_7.png "Expand the results")

## Exercise 4: Scale the application and test HA

**Duration**: 20 minutes

At this point, you have deployed a single instance of the web and API service containers. In this exercise, you will increase the number of container instances for the web service and scale the front-end on the existing cluster.

### Task 1: Increase service instances from the Azure Portal

In this task, you will increase the number of instances for the API deployment in the AKS Azure Portal blade. While it is deploying, you will observe the changing status.

1. In the AKS blade in the Azure Portal select **Workloads** and then select the **API** deployment.

2. Select **YAML** in the window that loads and scroll down until you find **replicas**. Change the number of replicas to **2**, and then select **Review + save**. When prompted, check **Confirm manifest change** and select **Save**.

   ![In the edit YAML dialog, 2 is entered in the desired number of replicas.](images/2021-03-26-16-49-32.png "Setting replicas to 2")

   > **Note**: If the deployment completes quickly, you may not see the deployment Waiting states in the portal, as described in the following steps.

3. From the Replica Set view for the API, you will see it is now deploying and that there is one healthy instance and one pending instance.

   ![Replica Sets is selected under Workloads in the navigation menu on the left, and at right, Pods status: 1 pending, 1 running is highlighted. Below that, a red arrow points at the API deployment in the Pods box.](images/api-replica-set.png "View replica details")

4. From the navigation menu, select **Workloads**. Note that the api Deployment has an alert and shows a pod count 1 of 2 instances (shown as `1/2`).

   ![In the Deployments box, the api service is highlighted with a grey timer icon at left and a pod count of 1/2 listed at right.](images/2021-03-26-16-50-38.png "View api active pods")

   > **Note**: If you receive an error about insufficient CPU that is OK. We will see how to deal with this in the next Task (Hint: you can use the **Insights** option in the AKS Azure Portal to review the **Node** status and view the Kubernetes event logs).

   At this point, here is a health overview of the environment:

   - One Deployment and one Replica Set are each healthy for the web service.

   - The api Deployment and Replica Set are in a warning state.

   - Two pods are healthy in the 'default' namespace.

5. Open the Contoso Neuro Conference web application. The application should still work without errors as you navigate to Speakers and Sessions pages.

   - Navigate to the `/stats` page. You will see information about the hosting environment including:

     - **webTaskId:** The task identifier for the web service instance.

     - **taskId:** The task identifier for the API service instance.

     - **hostName:** The hostname identifier for the API service instance.

     - **pid:** The process id for the API service instance.

     - **mem:** Some memory indicators returned from the API service instance.

     - **counters:** Counters for the service itself, as returned by the API service instance.

     - **uptime:** The up time for the API service.

### Task 2: Resolve failed provisioning of replicas

In this task, you will resolve the failed API replicas. These failures occur due to the clusters' inability to meet the requested resources.

1. In the AKS blade in the Azure Portal select **Workloads** and then select the **API** deployment. Select the **YAML** navigation item.

2. In the **YAML** screen scroll down and change the following items:

   - Modify **ports** and remove the **hostPort**. Two Pods cannot map to the same host port.

      ```yaml
      ports:
        - containerPort: 3001
          protocol: TCP
      ```

   - Modify the **cpu** and set it to **100m**. CPU is divided between all Pods on a Node.

      ```yaml
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 128Mi
      ```

   Select **Review + save** and, when prompted, confirm the changes and select **Save**.

   ![In the edit YAML dialog, showing two changes required.](images/2021-03-26-16-56-28.png "Modify deployment manifest")

3. Return to the **Workloads** main view on the AKS Azure Portal and you will now see that the Deployment is healthy with two Pods operating.

   ![In the Workload view with the API deployment highlighted.](images/healthy-deployment.png "API deployment is now healthy")

### Task 3: Restart containers and test HA

In this task, you will restart containers and validate that the restart does not impact the running service.

1. Open the sample web application and navigate to the "Stats" page as shown.

   ![The Stats page is visible in this screenshot of the Contoso Neuro web application.](images/image123.png "Contoso web task details")

2. In the AKS blade in the Azure Portal open the api Deployment and increase the required replica count to `4`. Use the same process as Exercise 4, Task 1.

   ![In the left menu the Deployments item is selected. The API deployment is highlighted in the Deployments list box.](images/2021-03-26-17-30-28.png "API pod deployments")

3. After a few moments you will find that the API deployment is now running 4 replicas successfully.

4. Return to the browser tab with the web application stats page loaded. Refresh the page over and over. You will not see any errors, but you will see the api host name change between the two api pod instances periodically. The task id and pid might also change between the two api pod instances.

   ![On the Stats page in the Contoso Neuro web application, two different api host name values are highlighted.](images/image126.png "View web task hostname")

5. After refreshing enough times to see that the `hostName` value is changing, and the service remains healthy, you can open the **Replica Sets** view for the API in the Azure Portal.

6. On this view you can see the hostName value shown in the web application stats page matches the pod names for the pods that are running.

   ![Viewing replica set in the Azure Portal.](images/2021-03-26-17-31-02.png "Viewing replica set in the Azure Portal")

7. Select two of the Pods at random and choose **Delete**.

   ![The context menu for a pod in the pod list is expanded with the Delete item selected.](images/2021-03-26-17-31-31.png "Delete running pod instance")

8. Kubernetes will launch new Pods to meet the required replica count. Depending on your view you may see the old instances Terminating and new instances being Created.

   ![The first row of the Pods box is highlighted, and the pod has a green check mark and is running.](images/2021-03-26-17-31-54.png "API Pods changing state")

9. Return to the API Deployment and scale it back to `1` replica. See Step 2 above for how to do this if you are unsure.

10. Return to the sample web site's stats page in the browser and refresh while Kubernetes is scaling down the number of Pods. You will notice that only one API host name shows up, even though you may still see several running pods in the API replica set view. Even though several pods are running, Kubernetes will no longer send traffic to the pods it has selected to terminate. In a few moments, only one pod will show in the API Replica Set view.

    ![Replica Sets is selected under Workloads in the navigation menu on the left. On the right are the Details and Pods boxes. Only one API host name, which has a green check mark and is listed as running, appears in the Pods box.](images/2021-03-26-17-32-24.png "View replica details")

### Task 4: Configure Cosmos DB Autoscale

In this task, you will setup Autoscale on Azure Cosmos DB.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the `fabmedical-[SUFFIX]` **Azure Cosmos DB Account**.

2. Select **Data Explorer**.

3. Within **Data Explorer**, expand the `contentdb` database, then expand the `sessions` collection.

4. Under the `sessions` collection, select **Scale & Settings**.

5. On the **Scale & Settings**, select **Autoscale** for the **Throughput** setting under **Scale**.

    ![The screenshot displays Cosmos DB Scale and Settings tab with Autoscale selected](images/cosmosdb-autoscale.png "CosmosDB collection scale and settings")

6. Select **Save**.

7. Perform the same task to enable **Autoscale** Throughput on the `speakers` collection.

### Task 5: Test Cosmos DB Autoscale

In this task, you will run a performance test script that will test the Autoscale feature of Azure Cosmos DB so you can see that it will now scale greater than 400 RU/s.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the `fabmedical-[SUFFIX]` **Cosmos DB account**.

2. Select **Connection String** under **Settings**.

3. On the **Connection String** pane, copy the **HOST**, **USERNAME**, and **PRIMARY PASSWORD** values. Save these for use later.

    ![The Cosmos DB account Connection String pane with the fields to copy highlighted.](images/cosmos-connection-string-pane.png "View CosmosDB connection string")

4. Open the Azure Cloud Shell, and **SSH** to the **Build agent VM**.

5. On the **Build agent VM**, navigate to the `~/Fabmedical` directory.

    ```bash
    cd ~/Fabmedical
    ```

6. Run the following command to open the `perftest.sh` script for editing in Vim.

    ```bash
    vi perftest.sh
    ```

7. There are several variables declared at the top of the `perftest.sh` script. Modify the **host**, **username**, and **password** variables by setting their values to the corresponding Cosmos DB Connection String values that were copied previously.

    ![The screenshot shows Vim with perftest.sh file open and variables set to Cosmos DB Connection String values.](images/cosmos-perf-test-variables.png "Modify the connection information in Vim")

8. Save the file and exit Vim.

9. Run the following command to execute the `perftest.sh` script to run a small load test against Cosmos DB. This script will consume RU's in Cosmos DB by inserting many documents into the Sessions container.

    ```bash
    bash ./perftest.sh
    ```

    > **Note:** The script will take a minute to complete executing.

10. Once the script has completed, navigate back to the **Cosmos DB account** in the Azure portal.

11. Scroll down on the **Overview** pane of the **Cosmos DB account** blade, and locate the **Request Charge** graph.

    > **Note:** It may take 2 - 5 minutes for the activity on the Cosmos DB collection to appear in the activity log. Wait a couple minutes and then refresh the pane if the recent Request charge doesn't show up right now.

12. Notice that the **Request charge** now shows there was activity on the **Cosmos DB account** that exceeded the 400 RU/s limit that was previously set before Autoscale was turned on.

    ![The screenshot shows the Cosmos DB request charge graph showing recent activity from performance test](images/cosmos-request-charge.png "Recent CosmosDB activity graph")

## Exercise 5: Working with services and routing application traffic

**Duration**: 1 hour

In the previous exercise, we introduced a restriction to the scale properties of the service. In this exercise, you will configure the api deployments to create pods that use dynamic port mappings to eliminate the port resource constraint during scale activities.

Kubernetes services can discover the ports assigned to each pod, allowing you to run multiple instances of the pod on the same agent node --- something that is not possible when you configure a specific static port (such as 3001 for the API service).

### Task 1: Update an external service to support dynamic discovery with a load balancer

In this task, you will update the web service so that it supports dynamic discovery through an Azure load balancer.

1. From AKS **Kubernetes resources** menu, select **Deployments** under **Workloads**. From the list select the **web** deployment.

2. Select **YAML**, then select the **JSON** tab.

3. First locate the replicas node and update the required count to `4`.

4. Next, scroll to the web containers spec as shown in the screenshot. Remove the hostPort entry for the web container's port mapping.

   ![This is a screenshot of the Edit a Deployment dialog box with various displayed information about spec, containers, ports, and env. The ports node, containerPort: 3001 and protocol: TCP are highlighted.](images/2021-03-26-18-22-39.png "Remove web container hostPort entry")

5. Select **Review + save** and then confirm the change and **Save**.

6. Check the status of the scale out by refreshing the web deployment's view. From the navigation menu, select **Pods** from under Workloads. Select the **web** pods. From this view, you should see an error like that shown in the following screenshot.

   ![Deployments is selected under Workloads in the navigation menu on the left. On the right are the Details and New Replica Set boxes. The web deployment is highlighted in the New Replica Set box, indicating an error.](images/2021-03-26-18-23-38.png "View Pod deployment events")

Like the API deployment, the web deployment used a fixed _hostPort_, and your ability to scale was limited by the number of available agent nodes. However, after resolving this issue for the web service by removing the _hostPort_ setting, the web deployment is still unable to scale past two pods due to CPU constraints. The deployment is requesting more CPU than the web application needs, so you will fix this constraint in the next task.

### Task 2: Adjust CPU constraints to improve scale

In this task, you will modify the CPU requirements for the web service so that it can scale out to more instances.

1. Re-open the JSON view for the web deployment and then find the **cpu** resource requirements for the web container. Change this value to `125m`.

   ![This is a screenshot of the Edit a Deployment dialog box with various displayed information about ports, env, and resources. The resources node, with cpu: 125m selected, is highlighted.](images/2021-03-26-18-24-06.png "Change cpu value")

2. Select **Review + save**, confirm the change and then select **Save** to update the deployment.

3. From the navigation menu, select **Replica Sets** under **Workloads**. From the view's Replica Sets list select the web replica set.

4. When the deployment update completes, four web pods should be shown in running state.

   ![Four web pods are listed in the Pods box, and all have green check marks and are listed as Running.](images/2021-03-26-18-24-35.png "Four pods running")

### Task 3: Perform a rolling update

In this task, you will edit the web application source code to add Application Insights and update the Docker image used by the deployment. Then you will perform a rolling update to demonstrate how to deploy a code change.

1. Execute this command in Azure Cloud Shell to retrieve the instrumentation key for the `content-web` Application Insights resource:

   ```bash
   az resource show -g fabmedical-[SUFFIX] -n content-web --resource-type "Microsoft.Insights/components" --query properties.InstrumentationKey -o tsv
   ```

   Copy this value. You will use it later.

   > **Note:** if you have a blank result check that the command you issued refers to the right resource.

2. On your lab VM update your fabmedical repository files by pulling the latest changes from the git repository:

   ```bash
   cd ~/fabmedical/content-web
   git pull
   ```

3. Install support for Application Insights.

   ```bash
   npm install applicationinsights --save
   ```

4. Edit the `app.js` file using Vim or Visual Studio Code remote and add the following lines immediately after `express` is instantiated on line 6:

   ```javascript
   const appInsights = require("applicationinsights");
   appInsights.setup("[YOUR APPINSIGHTS KEY]");
   appInsights.start();
   ```

   ![A screenshot of the code editor showing updates in context of the app.js file](images/hol-2019-10-02_12-33-29.png "AppInsights updates in app.js")

5. Save changes and close the editor.

6. Push these changes to your repository so that GitHub Actions CI will build and deploy a new Container image.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added Application Insights"
   git push
   ```

7. Visit the `content-web` Action for your GitHub Fabmedical repository and see the new Image being deployed into your Kubernetes cluster.

8. While this update runs, return the Azure Portal in the browser.

9. From the navigation menu, select **Replica Sets** under **Workloads**. From this view, you will see a new replica set for the web, which may still be in the process of deploying (as shown below) or already fully deployed.

    ![At the top of the list, a new web replica set is listed as a pending deployment in the Replica Set box.](images/2021-03-26-18-25-30.png "Pod deployment is in progress")

10. While the deployment is in progress, you can navigate to the web application and visit the stats page at `/stats`. Refresh the page as the rolling update executes. Observe that the service is running normally, and tasks continue to be load balanced.

    ![On the Stats page, the hostName is highlighted.](images/image145.png "On Stats page hostName is displayed")

### Task 4: Configure Kubernetes Ingress

In this task you will setup a Kubernetes Ingress using an [nginx proxy server](https://nginx.org/en/) to take advantage of path-based routing and TLS termination.

1. Within the Azure Cloud Shell, run the following command to add the nginx stable Helm repository:

    ```bash
    helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
    ```

2. Update your helm package list.

   ```bash
   helm repo update
   ```

   > **Note**: If you get a "no repositories found." error, then run the following command. This will add back the official Helm "stable" repository.
   >
   > ```bash
   > helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable 
   > ```

3. Create a namespace in Kubernetes to install the Ingress resources.

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace ingress-demo
    ```

4. Install the Ingress Controller resource to handle ingress requests as they come in. The Ingress Controller will receive a public IP of its own on the Azure Load Balancer and be able to handle requests for multiple services over port 80 and 443.

   ```bash
   helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
    --namespace ingress-demo \
    --set controller.replicaCount=2 \
    --set controller.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
    --set defaultBackend.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux \
    --set controller.admissionWebhooks.patch.nodeSelector."beta\.kubernetes\.io/os"=linux
   ```

5. In the Azure Portal under **Services and ingresses** copy the IP Address for the **External IP** for the `nginx-ingress-RANDOM-nginx-ingress` service.

   ![A screenshot of the Kubernetes management dashboard showing the ingress controller settings.](images/2021-03-26-18-26-13.png "Copy ingress controller settings")

    > **Note**: It could take a few minutes to refresh, alternately, you can find the IP using the following command in Azure Cloud Shell.
    >
    > ```bash
    > kubectl get svc --namespace ingress-demo
    > ```
    >
   ![A screenshot of Azure Cloud Shell showing the command output.](images/Ex4-Task5.5a.png "View the ingress controller LoadBalancer")

6. Open the [Azure Portal Resource Groups blade](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customPortal=false#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroups) and locate the Resource Group that was automatically created to host the Node Pools for AKS. It will have the naming format of `MC_fabmedical-[SUFFIX]_fabmedical-[SUFFIX]_[REGION]`.

7. Within the Azure Cloud Shell, create a script to update the public DNS name for the ingress external IP.

   ```bash
   code update-ip.sh
   ```

   Paste the following as the contents. Be sure to replace the following placeholders in the script:

   - `[INGRESS PUBLIC IP]`: Replace this with the IP Address copied from step 5.
   - `[AKS NODEPOOL RESOURCE GROUP]`: Replace with the name of the Resource Group copied from step 6.
   - `[SUFFIX]`: Replace this with the same SUFFIX value used previously for this lab.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Public IP address
   IP="[INGRESS PUBLIC IP]"

   # Resource Group that contains AKS Node Pool
   KUBERNETES_NODE_RG="[AKS NODEPOOL RESOURCE GROUP]"

   # Name to associate with public IP address
   DNSNAME="fabmedical-[SUFFIX]-ingress"

   # Get the resource-id of the public ip
   PUBLICIPID=$(az network public-ip list --resource-group $KUBERNETES_NODE_RG --query "[?ipAddress!=null]|[?contains(ipAddress, '$IP')].[id]" --output tsv)

   # Update public ip address with dns name
   az network public-ip update --ids $PUBLICIPID --dns-name $DNSNAME
   ```

   ![A screenshot of cloud shell editor showing the updated IP and SUFFIX values.](images/Ex4-Task5.6.png "Update the IP and SUFFIX values")

8. Save changes and close the editor.

9. Run the update script.

   ```bash
   bash ./update-ip.sh
   ```

10. Verify the IP update by visiting the URL in your browser.

    > **Note**: It is normal to receive a 404 message at this time.

    ```text
    http://fabmedical-[SUFFIX]-ingress.[AZURE-REGION].cloudapp.azure.com/
    ```

    ![A screenshot of the fabmedical browser URL.](images/Ex4-Task5.9.png "fabmedical browser URL")

11. Use helm to install `cert-manager`, a tool that can provision SSL certificates automatically from letsencrypt.org.

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace cert-manager

    kubectl label namespace cert-manager cert-manager.io/disable-validation=true

    kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.0.1/cert-manager.yaml
    ```

12. Cert manager will need a custom ClusterIssuer resource to handle requesting SSL certificates.

    ```bash
    code clusterissuer.yml
    ```

    The following resource configuration should work as is:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    metadata:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    spec:
      acme:
        # The ACME server URL
        server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
        # Email address used for ACME registration
        email: user@fabmedical.com
        # Name of a secret used to store the ACME account private key
        privateKeySecretRef:
          name: letsencrypt-prod
        # Enable HTTP01 validations
        solvers:
        - http01:
            ingress:
              class: nginx
    ```

13. Save changes and close the editor.

14. Create the issuer using `kubectl`.

    ```bash
    kubectl create --save-config=true -f clusterissuer.yml
    ```

15. Now you can create a certificate object.

    > **Note**:
    >
    > Cert-manager might have already created a certificate object for you using ingress-shim.
    >
    > To verify that the certificate was created successfully, use the `kubectl describe certificate tls-secret` command.
    >
    > If a certificate is already available, skip to step 16.

    ```bash
    code certificate.yml
    ```

    Use the following as the contents and update the `[SUFFIX]` and `[AZURE-REGION]` to match your ingress DNS name

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: Certificate
    metadata:
      name: tls-secret
    spec:
      secretName: tls-secret
      dnsNames:
        - fabmedical-[SUFFIX]-ingress.[AZURE-REGION].cloudapp.azure.com
      issuerRef:
        name: letsencrypt-prod
        kind: ClusterIssuer
    ```

16. Save changes and close the editor.

17. Create the certificate using `kubectl`.

    ```bash
    kubectl create --save-config=true -f certificate.yml
    ```

    > **Note**: To check the status of the certificate issuance, use the `kubectl describe certificate tls-secret` command and look for an _Events_ output similar to the following:
    >
    > ```text
    > Type    Reason         Age   From          Message
    > ----    ------         ----  ----          -------
    > Normal  Generated           38s   cert-manager  Generated new private key
    > Normal  GenerateSelfSigned  38s   cert-manager  Generated temporary self signed certificate
    > Normal  OrderCreated        38s   cert-manager  Created Order resource "tls-secret-3254248695"
    > Normal  OrderComplete       12s   cert-manager  Order "tls-secret-3254248695" completed successfully
    > Normal  CertIssued          12s   cert-manager  Certificate issued successfully
    > ```

    It can take between 5 and 30 minutes before the tls-secret becomes available. This is due to the delay involved with provisioning a TLS cert from letsencrypt.

18. Now you can create an ingress resource for the content applications.

    ```bash
    code content.ingress.yml
    ```

    Use the following as the contents and update the `[SUFFIX]` and `[AZURE-REGION]` to match your ingress DNS name:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: content-ingress
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: "true"
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
        cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    spec:
      tls:
      - hosts:
          - fabmedical-[SUFFIX]-ingress.[AZURE-REGION].cloudapp.azure.com
        secretName: tls-secret
      rules:
      - host: fabmedical-[SUFFIX]-ingress.[AZURE-REGION].cloudapp.azure.com
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /(.*)
            backend:
              serviceName: web
              servicePort: 80
          - path: /content-api/(.*)
            backend:
              serviceName: api
              servicePort: 3001
    ```

19. Save changes and close the editor.

20. Create the ingress using `kubectl`.

    ```bash
    kubectl create --save-config=true -f content.ingress.yml
    ```

21. Refresh the ingress endpoint in your browser. You should be able to visit the speakers and sessions pages and see all the content.

22. Visit the API directly, by navigating to `/content-api/sessions` at the ingress endpoint.

    ![A screenshot showing the output of the sessions content in the browser.](images/Ex4-Task5.19.png "Content api sessions")

23. Test TLS termination by visiting both services again using `https`.

    > It can take between 5 and 30 minutes before the SSL site becomes available. This is due to the delay involved with provisioning a TLS cert from letsencrypt.

### Task 5: Multi-region Load Balancing with Traffic Manager

In this task, you will setup Azure Traffic Manager as a multi-region load balancer. This will enable you to provision an AKS instance of the app in a secondary Azure region with load balancing between the two regions.

1. Within the Azure Portal, select **+ Create a resource**.

2. Search the marketplace for **Traffic Manager profile**, select this resource type, then select **Create**.

    ![The screenshot shows Traffic Manager profile in the Azure marketplace.](images/tm-marketplace.png "Traffic Manager profile")

3. On the **Create Traffic Manager profile** blade, enter the following values, then select **Create**.

    - Name: `fabmedical-[SUFFIX]'
    - Routing Method: **Performance**
    - Resource Group: `fabmedical-[SUFFIX]`

    ![The screenshot shows the Create Traffic Manager profile blade with all values entered.](images/tm-create.png "Create Traffic Manager profile configuration")

4. Navigate to the newly created `fabmedical-[SUFFIX]` **Traffic Manager profile**.

5. On the **Traffic Manager profile** blade, select **Endpoints** under **Settings**.

6. On the **Endpoints** pane, select **+ Add** to add a new endpoint to be load balanced.

7. On the **Add endpoint** pane, enter the following values for the new endpoint, then select **Add**.

    - Type: **External endpoint**
    - Name: `primary`
    - Fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP: `fabmedical-[SUFFIX]-ingress.[AZURE-REGION].cloudapp.azure.com`
    - Location: Choose the same Azure Region as AKS.

    Be sure to replace the `[SUFFIX]` and `[AZURE-REGION]` placeholders.

    ![Add endpoint configuration pane with values entered.](images/tm-add-endpoint-primary.png "Add endpoint configuration")

8. Notice the list of **Endpoints** now shows the **primary** endpoint that was added.

9. On the **Traffic Manager profile** blade, select **Overview**.

10. On the **Overview** pane, copy the **DNS name** for the Traffic Manager profile.

    ![The Traffic Manager profile overview pane with the DNS name highlighted](images/tm-overview.png "fabmedical Traffic Manager profile DNS name")

11. Navigate back to Azure Cloud Shell. Open the `content.ingress.yml` file you created previously. Append the following YAML code to the file. Please maintain proper indentation. These YAML statements will ensure that you route requests originating from the traffic manager profile to the correct service.

  ```yaml
    - host: fabmedical-cnr.trafficmanager.net
      http:
        paths:
        - path: /(.*)
          backend:
            serviceName: web
            servicePort: 80
        - path: /content-api/(.*)
          backend:
            serviceName: api
            servicePort: 3001
  ```

12. Open a new web browser tab and navigate to the Traffic Manager profile **DNS name** that as just copied.

    ![The screenshot shows the Contoso Neuro website using the Traffic Manager profile DNS name](images/tm-endpoint-website.png "Traffic Manager show Contoso home page")

13. When setting up a multi-region hosted application in AKS, you will setup a secondary AKS in another Azure Region, then add its endpoint to its Traffic Manager profile to be load balanced.

    > **Note:** You can setup the secondary AKS and instance of the Contoso Neuro website on your own if you wish. The steps to set that up are the same as most of the steps you went through in this lab to setup the primary AKS and app instance.

## After the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will de-provision any Azure resources created in support of this lab.

1. Delete the Resource Groups in which you placed all your Azure resources.

   - From the Portal, navigate to the blade of your **Resource Group** and then select **Delete** in the command bar at the top.

   - Confirm the deletion by re-typing the resource group name and selecting Delete.

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.
