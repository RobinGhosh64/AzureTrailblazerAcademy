## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on-lab, you will build an end-to-end data analytics with machine learning solution using Azure Synapse Analytics. The information will be presented in the context of a retail scenario. We will be heavily leveraging Azure Synapse Studio, a tool that conveniently unifies the most common data operations from ingestion, transformation, querying, and visualization.

## Overview

In this lab various features of Azure Synapse Analytics will be explored. Azure Synapse Analytics Studio is a single tool that every team member can use collaboratively. Synapse Studio will be the only tool used throughout this lab through data ingestion, cleaning, and transforming raw files to using Notebooks to train, register, and consume a Machine learning model. The lab will also provide hands-on-experience monitoring and prioritizing data related workloads.

## Solution architecture

![Architecture diagram explained in the next paragraph.](images/archdiagram.png "Architecture Diagram")

This lab explores the cold data scenario of ingesting various types of raw data files. These files can exist anywhere. The file types used in this lab are CSV, parquet, and JSON. This data will be ingested into Synapse Analytics via Pipelines. From there, the data can be transformed and enriched using various tools such as data flows, Synapse Spark, and Synapse SQL (both provisioned and serverless). Once processed, data can be queried using Synapse SQL tooling. Azure Synapse Studio also provides the ability to author notebooks to further process data, create datasets, train, and create machine learning models. These models can then be stored in a storage account or even in a SQL table. These models can then be consumed via various methods, including T-SQL. The foundational component supporting all aspects of Azure Synapse Analytics is the ADLS Gen 2 Data Lake.

5. On the **Create a resource group** screen, select your desired Subscription and Region. For Resource group, enter **Synapse-MCW**, then select the **Review + Create** button.

    ![The Create a resource group form is displayed populated with Synapse-MCW as the resource group name.](images/bhol_resourcegroupform.png "Naming the resource group")

6. Select the **Create** button once validation has passed.

### Task 3: Create the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace

1. Deploy the workspace through the following Azure ARM template (press the button below):

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FAzureTrailblazerAcademy%2Fmaster%2Fmonth2%2Flabs%2Flab_dw%2Fscripts%2Fautomation%2F00-asa-workspace-core.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png" /></a>

2. On the **Custom deployment** form:

    - **Subscription:** Select your subscription
    - **Resource Group:** Select the Resource Group you created earlier
    - **UNique Suffix:** Enter a random suffix to be added to resources created by this template (ex. your initials followed by your birth year
    - **SQL Administrator Login Password:**: at@February2021

    ![The Custom deployment form is displayed with example data populated.](images/bhol_customdeploymentform.png "Configuring the custom deployment")
  
3. Check the **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**, then select the **Purchase** button.

    > **Note**: You may experience a deployment step failing in regard to Role Assignment. This error may safely be ignored.

### Task 4: Download lab artifacts

1. In the Azure Portal, open the Azure Cloud Shell by selecting its icon from the right side of the top toolbar. Be sure to select **Powershell** as the shell type.

    ![A portion of the Azure Portal taskbar is displayed with the Cloud Shell icon highlighted.](images/bhol_azurecloudshellmenu.png "Opening the Cloud Shell")

    > **Note**: If you are prompted to create a storage account for the Cloud Shell, agree to have it created.

2. In the Cloud Shell window, enter the following command to clone the repository files.

    ```PowerShell
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/AzureTrailblazerAcademy.git Synapse-MCW
    ```

3. Keep the Cloud Shell open.

### Task 5: Establish a user context

1. In the Cloud Shell, execute the following command:

    ```cli
    az login
    ```

2. A message will be displayed asking you to open a new tab in your web browser, navigate to [https://microsoft.com/devicelogin](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin) and to enter a code for authentication.

   ![A message is displayed indicating to enter an authentication code on the device login page.](images/bhol_devicelogin.png "Authentication message")

   ![A dialog is shown requesting the entry of a code.](images/bhol_clicodescreen.png "Authentication dialog")

3. Once complete, you may close the tab from the previous step and return to the Cloud Shell.

### Task 6: Run environment setup PowerShell script

When executing the script below, it is important to let the scripts run to completion. Some tasks may take longer than others to run. When a script completes execution, you will be returned to a command prompt.

1. In the Cloud Shell, change the current directory to the **automation** folder of the cloned repository by executing the following:

    ```PowerShell
    cd './Synapse-MCW/month2/labs/lab_dw/scripts/automation'
    ```

2. Execute the **01-environment-setup.ps1** script by executing the following command:

    ```PowerShell
    ./01-environment-setup.ps1
    ```

    You will be prompted to enter the name of your desired Azure Subscription. You can copy and paste the value from the list to select one. You will also be prompted for the following information for this script:

    | Prompt |
    |--------|
    | Enter the desired Azure Subscription for this lab [you will be able to copy and paste from a listing] |
    | Enter the name of the resource group containing the Azure Synapse Analytics Workspace |
    | Enter the SQL Administrator password you used in the deployment |
    | Enter the unique suffix you used in the deployment |

    ![The Azure Cloud Shell window is displayed with a sample of the output from the preceding command.](images/bhol_sampleshelloutput.png "The Azure Cloud Shell output")

3. At the end of the script, you should see a message indicating **Environment validation has succeeded**.

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
